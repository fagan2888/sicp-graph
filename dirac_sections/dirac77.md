#77. The supplementary conditions

We must now go back to the Maxwell equation (2), which we have
ignored so far. We cannot take this equation over directly into the
quantum theory without getting inconsistencies. The left-hand side
of the equation does not commute with A,,(x’), according to the
quantum conditions (28), so this left-hand side cannot vanish. The
way out of the difficulty was shown by Fermitf It consists in adopting
a less stringent equation, namely the equation

(8AP/8xp)|P> = 0, (50)
and assuming it to hold for any [P) corresponding to a state that can
actually occur in nature. There is one equation (50) for each point
in space-time and these equations must all hold for any ket corre-
sponding to a state that can actually occur.

We shall call a condition such as (50), which a ket has to satisfy to
correspond to an actual state, a supplementary condition. The exis-
tence of supplementary conditions in the theory does not mean any
departure from or modification in the general principles of quantum
mechanics. The principle of superposition of states and the whole of
the general theory of states, dynamical variables, and observables,
as given in Chapter II, apply also when there are supplementary

conditions, provided we impose a further requirement on a linear
operator in order that it may represent an observable. We deﬁne a
linear operator to be physical if it has the property that, when it
operates on any ket satisfying the supplementary conditions, it pro-
duces another ket satisfying the supplementary conditions. In order
that a linear operator may represent an observable it must evidently
satisfy the requirement of being physical, in addition to the require-
ments of § l0.

We have already had an example of supplementary conditions in
the theory of systems containing several similar particles. The con-
dition that only symmetrical wave functions, or only antisymmetrical
wave functions, represent states that can actually occur in nature, is
precisely of the same type as condition (50) and is what we are now
calling a supplementary condition. In this theory the requirement
that a linear operator shall be physical is that it shall be symmetrical
between the similar particles.

When we introduce supplementary conditions into our theory we
must verify that they are consistent, i.e. not too restrictive to allow
any ket at all to satisfy them. If we have more than one supplementary
condition, we can deduce further supplementary conditions from them
by taking P.B.s of the operators in them; thus if we have

U|P> = 0, V|P> = 0, (51)

we can deduce
W, Vl|P> = 9, [U15], VHIP) = 0, (52)

and so on. To verify that our supplementary conditions are consistent
we have to look into all the further supplementary conditions obtain-
able by this procedure to see that they can be satisfied, which we can
usually do by showing that after a certain point the further supple-
mentary conditions are all either identically ,satisfied or repetitions
of the previous ones.

We must also verify that the supplementary conditions are in agree-
ment with the equations of motion. In the Heisenberg picture, for
which the ket (P) in (51 )is fixed, we shall have different supplementary
conditions referring to differenttimes and they must all be consistent,
in the way discussed above. In the Schrodinger picture, for which the
ket |P) varieswith the time inaccordance with Schrodinger ’S equation,
we require that if |P) satisfies the supplementary conditions initially
it satisfies them always. This'means that d|P>/dt must satisfy the

supplementary conditions, or that H {P} must satisfy the supplemen-
tary conditions, or that H must be physical.
It is convenient When We have a supplementary condition UIP) = 0

and to call (53 ) a Weak equation, in distinction to an ordinary or strong
equation. A Weak equation gives another Weak equation if it is
multiplied by any factor on the left, but does not in general give a valid
equation if it is multiplied by a factor on the right. Thus a Weak
equation must not be used in Working out P.B.s. With this Way of
speaking, the requirement (52) that the supplementary conditions are
consistent becomes the requirement that the P.B.s of the operators
in the supplementary conditions shall vanish Weakly.

The condition for a dynamical variable £1 to be physical is that, for
each supplementary condition UIP) = O, We have

UEIP) = 0,
and hence [U , 5]] P) = O.

Thus the condition is that the P.B. of the dynamical variable With
each of the operators of the supplementary conditions shall vanish

Weakly.
Let us noW return to electrodynamics. We take equation (2) to be

a Weak equation, so it should be Written

In the Heisenberg picture We have one of these equations for each
point x. To check their consistency, We take tWo arbitrary points x
and a2’ in space-time and form the P.B.

Evaluating it With the help of (28), We get

from (25), so the requirements for consistency are satisﬁed strongly.
As We have veriﬁed that the supplementary conditions are consistent
at all times in the Heisenberg picture, We have veriﬁed that they are
in agreement With the equations of motion.

Since equation (54) is only a Weak equation, any of its consequences

in the ordinary Maxwell theory will be valid in the quantum theory
only as weak equations. The equations

div}! = 0, Elf/ﬁt = --curl 6

follow simply from the deﬁnitions of € and}?! in terms of the potentials,
so they are valid strongly in the quantum theory. The other Maxwell
equations for empty space, namely

div é‘ ﬁ 0, Bé/ﬁt z curllf, (55)

are weak equations in the quantum theory, because one needs the
help of (54) as well as (1) in deriving them.

The ﬁeld quantities é andﬂ are components of the antisymmetric
tensor 8A"/8a:H-6AP/6x,. The P.B. of the tensor with the operator
of (54) at a general point x’ is

It follows that é‘ and J?‘ are physical. The potentials A“ are not
physical.

The supplementary conditions affecting the dynamical variables at
a particular time are

Higher differentiations with respect to x0 do not give independent
equations, but equations which are consequences of these and the
strong equation (1). Thus in terms of the Schrodinger variables of
§ 76, the supplementary conditions are

B,+A,f m 0 (57)
and (AJ-l-BJ i=5 O. (58)

Equation (5 8)is the same as the ﬁrst of equations (55)and may also

be written, from (39),
V2(A0+ U) m 0.

Since this holds throughout three-dimensional space, it leads to

A0+U ‘:5 0. (59)

§77 THE SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS 291

To set up a convenient representation, we introduce a standard ket
10F) satisfying the supplementary conditions

(Bo-1—A,.”)|0F) = 0, (AU-l- U)|OF> = 0, (61)
and also satisfying EIQOF) = 0. (52)

These conditions are consistent, because i}, commutes with the
operators in (61), and they are sufficient to ﬁx 10F) completely, apart
from a numerical factor, because the only independent dynamical
variables that we have are A,, B0, U, A,', .1241‘, it‘, and of these
AO-l- U, Bo-l-Af, 54k form a complete commuting set. With this
standard ket we can express any ket as

‘PTAQ, Bu» Mm) I951) (63)

Our representation is just the Fock representation so far as concerns
the transverse dynamical variables HQ‘, 5;,“ so ‘P’ must be a power
series in the variables Mk, with different terms in the series corre-
sponding to the presence of different numbers of photons. The number
of variables occurring in ‘P’ is a continuous infinity, so ‘l’ is what
mathematicians call a ‘functional’.

If the ket (63) satisfies the supplementary conditions, ‘F must be
independent of A, and B0, and thus a function only of the Mm. So
physical states are represented by kets of the form

‘PT-ﬁﬁk) i0F>> (54)

with ‘F a power series in the variables Mk. The standard ket 10F)
itself represents the physical state with no photons present, the perfect
vacuum.

Our Hamiltonian HF and its parts HFL, HFT have so far contained
arbitrary numerical terms. It is convenient to choose these terlns so
that HF , HFT are zero for the perfect vacuum. The result (60) shows
that HFL given by (48) or (49) has the numerical term in it correctly
chosen to make HFL have the value zero for the perfect vacuum, as
well as for every other physical state. We must take HFT to be

the transverse part of (19), in order that the numerical term in it may
be correctly chosen to give no Zero-point energy for the photons.
(47) differs from (65) by an inﬁnite numerical term, consisting of a
half-quantum of energy for each photon state.
