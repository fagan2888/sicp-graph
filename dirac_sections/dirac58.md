#58. Application to electrons

Let us consider the case when the similar particles are electrons.
This requires, according to Paulie exclusion principle discussed in
§54, that we take into account only the antisymmetrical states- It
is now necessary to make explicit reference to the fact that electrons
have spins, which show themselves through an angular momentum

220 SYSTEMS CONTAINING SEVERAL SIMILAR PARTICLES § 58

and a magnetic moment. "Fhe effect of ‘the spin on the motion of
an electron in an electromagnetic ﬁeld is not very great. There
are additional forces on the electron due to its magnetic moment,
requiring additional terms in the Hainiltonian. The spin angular
momentum does not have any direct action on the motion, but it comes
into play when there are forces tending to rotate the magnetic moment,
since the magnetic moment and angular momentum are constrained
to be always in the same direction. In the absence of a strong
magnetic ﬁeld these effects are all small, of the same order of magni-
tude as the corrections required by relativistic mechanics, and there
would be no point in taking them into account in a non-relativistic
theory. The importance of the spin lies not in these small effects on the
motion of the electron, but in the fact that it gives two internal states
to the electron, corresponding to the two possible values of the spin
component in any assigned direction, which causes a doubling in the
number of independent states of an electron. This fact has far-reaching
consequences when combined with Paulfs exclusion principle.

In dealing with an assembly of electrons we have two kinds of
dynamical variables. The first kind, which we may call the orbital
variables, consists of the coordinates x, y, z of all the electrons and
their conjugate momenta pm, p3,, pg. The second kind consists of the
spin variables, the variables ox, o”, Oz, as introduced in § 37, for all
the electrons. These two kinds of variables belong to different degrees
of freedom. According to §§ 2O and 21, a laet ﬁxing the state of the
whole systein may be of the form IA) IB), where [A js a ket referring
to the orbital variables alone and IB) is a ket referring to the spin
variables alone, and the general ket ﬁxing a state of the xvhole system
is a sum or integral of kets of this form. This way of looking at things
enables us to introduce two kinds of permutation operators, the ﬁrst
kind, PX say, applying to the orbital variables only and operating
only on the factor IA) and the second kind, P“ say, applying only
to the spin variables and operating only on the factor {B}. The Pﬁs
and P°'s can each be applied to any ket for the whole system, not
merely to certain special kets, like the P°"s of the preceding section.
The permutations P that we have had up to the present apply to all
the dynamical variables of the particles concerned, so for electrons

they will apply to both the orbital and the spin variables. This means
that each Pa equals the product

p, = PgPg. (M)

§58 APPLICATION TO ELECTRONS 221

We can now see the need for taking the spin variables into account
when applying Pauli's exclusion principle, eved if we neglect the spin
forces in the Hamiltonian. For any state occurring in nature each
Pa must have the value i1, according to whether it is an even or
an odd permutation, so from (24)

Pg Pg = i1. (25)

The theory of the three preceding sections would become trivial if
applied directly to electrons, for which each Pa = i1. We may,
however, apply it to the PX permutations of electrons. The P°'s are
constants of the motion if we neglect the terms in the Hamiltonian
that arise from the spin forces, since this neglect results in the
Hamiltonian not involving the spin dynamical variables a at all. The
P~*”s must then also be constants of the motion. We can now intro-
duce new X’s, equal to the average of all of the Pfs in each class, and
assert that for any permissible set of numerical values X’ for these X’s
there will be one exclusive set of states. Thus there exist exclusive sets
of states for systems containing many electrons even when we restrict
ourselves to a consideration of only those states that satisfy Pauli's
principle. The exclusiveness of the sets of states is now, of course,
only approximate, since the {s are constants only so long as we
neglect the spin forces. There will actually be a small probability for
a transition from a state in one set to a state in another.

Equation (25) gives us a simple connexion between the PX's and
Po's, which means that instead of studying the dynamical variables
P” we can get all the results we want, e.g. the characters X’, by
studying the dynamical variables P°. The P°'s are much easier to
study on account of there being only two independent states of spin
for each electron. This fact results in there being fewer characters X’
for the group of permutations of the a-variables than for the group
of general permutations, since it prevents a ket in the spin variables
from being antisymmetrical in more than two of them.

The study of the P°"s is made specially easy by the fact that we
can express them as algebraic functions of the dynamical variables c.
Consider the quantity

‘O12 z %{1+U$1 UzZ-i-Uyl aim-Fold 0:2,} Z %{1+(G1162)}'
With the help of equations (50) and (51) of § 37 we ﬁnd readily that
(G1, 62):: Z (Owl UxSFi-Uyl Gy2+Uz1az2)2 2 3“”2(G11 G2)! 

and hence that
01% = %{1+2(°'1>U2)+(°'1>52)2} = l. (27)

222 SYSTEMS CONTAINING SEVERAL SIMILAR PARTICLES §58

Again, we ﬁnd
O12 0'31 = %{ga:l+o'zc2'—igzl Uy2+iUy1 022%
011:2 012 = %{gx2+Ua:1+7'-Uy1 Uzz-iazi Uy2}
and hence O12 on == egg Om.
Similar relations hold for om and 0Z1 so that we have
012 61 z “'2 012
or O12 a1 OE == a2.
From this we can obtain with the help of (27)
O12 0'2 Of} = 0'1.

These commutation relations for O12 with o1 and a, are precisely the
same as those for P“ , the permutation consisting of the interchange
of the spin variables of electrons 1 and 2. Thus we can put

012 I CF52»

where c is a number. Equation (27) shows that c z j; 1. To deter-
mine which of these values for c is the correct one, we observe that
the eigenvalues of Pfz are 1, l, 1, -— 1, corresponding to the fact that
there exist three independent symmetrical and one antisymmetrical
state in the spin variables of two electrons, namely, with the notation
of §37, the states represented by the three symmetrical functions
f@(v;1)fa(v;2), f,e(v;1)fs(¢;2)> fawéllfgwéz)+f,e(<>';1)fa(v;2)= and the 011B
antisymmetrical function f,,,(af,1)f5(a;2)—_fﬂ(o;1)fa(o;2). Thus the mean
of the eigenvalues of Pfz is  Now the mean of the eigenvalues of
(a1, 0'2) is evidently zero and hence the mean of the eigenvalues of O12
is  Thus we must have c = +1, and so we can put

f2 m §,~{1—|—(a1, 02)}. (28)

In this way any permutation Pa consisting simply of an interchange
can be expressed as an algebraic function of the o's. Any other per-
mutation Pa can be expressed as a product of interchanges and can
therefore also be expressed as a function of the a's. With the help of
(25) we can now express the PX's as algebraic functions of the a’s and
eliminate the P°"s from the discussion. We have, since the — sign
must be taken in (25) when the permutations are interchanges and
since the square of an interchange is unity,

icz 2 ”%{1+(61» “zli- (29)
The formula (29) may conveniently be used for the evaluation of

§58 APPLICATION TO ELECTRONS 223

the characters X’ which deﬁne the exclusive sets of states. We have,
for example, for the permutations consisting of interchanges,
1 2
X12 = X( i2) = "ﬁprl-m 2 (Gr: 51)}-

If We introduce the dynamical variable s to describe the magnitude of
the total spin angular momentum, @1- 2 a, in units of ﬁ, through the

formula

in agreement With (3 9) of § 3 6, We have

22am c» = (g o... g =n)-- 2 (Gav a.)

= 4s(s—|— I)— 3n.
Hence

x12 = -;1,-[1 +ﬁ-fgqfﬁl = ~72“ 2i)(jii(f +1) ~ <30)

Thus X12 is expressible as a function of the dynamical variable s and
of n the number of electrons. Any of the other {s could be evaluated
on similar lines and Would have to be a function of s and n only, since
there are no other symmetrical functions of all the a dynamical
variables Which could be involved. There is therefore one set of
numerical values X’ for the X’s, and thus one exclusive set of states,
for each eigenvalue s’ of s. The eigenvalues of s are

the series terminating With 0 or 
We see in this Way that each of the stationary states of a system
With several electrons is an eigenstate of s, the magnitude in units of
ii of the total spin angular momentum s; 0,, belonging to a definite
'1"

eigenvalue s’. For any given s there Will be 2s +l possible values
for a component of the total spin vector in any i‘direction and these
will correspond to 2s’*—|— I independent stationary states With the same
energy. When We do not neglect the forces due to the spin magnetic
moments these 2s'—|—1 states will in general be split up into 2s’+l
states With slightly different energies, and Will thus form a multiplet
of multiplicity 2s + 1. Transitions in Which s’ changes, i.e. transitions
from one multiplicity to another, cannot occur When the spin forces
are neglected and Will have only a small probability of occurrence
When the spin forces are not neglected.

We can determine the energy-levels of a system with several
electrons to the first approximation by applying the theory of the
preceding section with the kets Ia’) referring only to the orbital
variables and using formula (23). If we consider only the Coulomb
forces between the electrons, then the interaction energy V will
consist of a sum of parts each referring to only two electrons, which
will result in all the matrix elements P}, vanishing except those for
which PX is the identical permutation or is simply an interchange of
two electrons. Thus (23) will reduce to

V PM’ Kigali-ﬂit» (31)
P1, being the matrix element referring to the interchange of electrons
r and s. Since the P°"s have the same properties as the PX's, any
function of the .P°"s will have the same eigenvalues as the corre-
sponding function of the P“”s, so that the right-hand side of (31)
will have the same eigenvalues as

VII-l“ 2 gSpiit-S‘?

T<S

or I4—%,;I4.{1+<@..¢.>} <32)

from (29). The eigenvalues of (32) will give the first-order corrections
in the energy-levels. The form of (32) shows that a model which
assumes a coupling energy between the spins of the various electrons,
of magnitude —-§-T/,'._,(c,.,cs) for the electrons in the ~r and s orbital
states, would meet with a fair amount of success. This coupling
energy is much greater than that of the spin magnetic moments. Such
models of the atom were in use before the justification by quantum
mechanics was obtained.

We may have two of the orbital states of the unperturbed system
the same, i.e. the kets W‘) in the orbital variables for two electrons
may be the same. Suppose ml) and I052) are the same. Then we must
take only those eigenvalues of (31) that are consistent with Pi; = l,
or those eigenvalues of (32) that are consistent with f2 = 1 or

f2 = -l. From (28) this condition gives (c131,) = — 3, so that
(c1+02)2 = 0. Thus the resultant of the two spins a, and a, is zero,
which may be interpreted as the spins a1 and a, being antiparallel.
Thus we may say that two electrons in the same orbital state have
their spins antiparallel. More ‘than two electrons cannot be in the
same orbital state.
