#76. The dynamical variables at one time

As a basis for a theory with interaction we must use the dynamical
variables at one time. The relationships between the dynamical
variables at one time (Le. their P.B.s) are not affected by the introduc-
tion of interaction. On the other hand the relationships between the
dynamical variables at different times (comprising the field equations
as well as the PQBfs" of variables at different times) are very much
affected by the interaction. The dynamical variables at one time form
a non-relativistic concept, but a very important concept in Hamil-
tonian theory.

For the case of the electromagnetic field the independent dynamical
variables at one time are A, and aAp/ﬁaso for all values of x1, x,, x3 for
the given x0. The higher time derivatives 62AP/8x02,..., are not
independent. Let us put

B’, T. 9i». (29)
8x0
Then we have A,,, Bpx, with the suffix X denoting 2:1, x2, x3, as the
dynamical variables at one time.
The Fourier resolution of these variables is, from (3)and (9),
Apx x J (Ap1<+gp-k)3”i(kx)d3k

B a m; f k,(A,,m-.Z,__k)@~1¢<*===> m '

We may reverse the Fourier transformation and express Aug-JIM,
amnd A Plf-"A W}, in terms of A, and B)“ respectively. Thus A,,,, and
A,,,, are determined by LA, B,“ for all x (at a given x,). The equa-
tions connecting A,,,, A,,,, with A, Bpx do not involve the time
explicitly. Thus the A, A,,,‘ form an alternative set of one-time
dynamical variables, on the same footing as the A, B,

When we work with the variables A,,, BM, we shall need to know

their P.B. relations. These may be obtained either from the Fourier
expansions (3 0) together with (16) and (1 7) or from the general P.B.
relation (28). The latter gives the required results more quickly.
Putting xf, = x0 in (28), we get

[A A,,] = o. (s1)

P-X’

Differentiating (2 8) with respect to x0 and then putting m}, = mo, we
get, with the help of (26),

[Bpxv A106] z 47rgpvs(xwx')' 
Differentiating (2 8) with respect to both x0 and x1, and then putting
w; = mo, W6 g“ [BM BM] = 0, (as)

since 82A(x)/8x§ = 0 for x0 = 0. Equations (31), (32), and (33) give
all the P.B. relations between the A,,, B, variables. They show that,
apart from numerical coefficients, the A,, can be looked upon as a set
of dynamical coordinates and the B,“ as their conjugate momenta,
there being a 5 function on the right-hand side of (32) instead of a
two-suffix 3 symbol on account of the number of degrees of freedom
being a continuous infinity.

We can decompose A, into a transverse and a longitudinal part,
as shown by equations ( 8 )and (6). We can do the same with B”, and
get

 

6U
B = $,+_ (34)
ax,
with Sﬂr/ﬁas, = O. (35)
From ( 7 )with —k substituted fork in the second term of the inte grand,

The corresponding equation for U is, since U = EV/ﬁxo,
U = _ f k,1¢,-1(A,,-.I1',_,)e~1=<1<=:=>d3k. (37)
The electric field is given by

Thus dive‘ = QgBr-vaa,

It is evident that any longitudinal variable commutes with any

out. We shall use the notation— for any ﬁeld function fx,

Si:   w
If in (-32)We put ‘p = w‘, v = s and differentiate the equation with
respect to 22,, We get
[BrxyuA-ﬁrxil r" 47Tgrssr(x—x’) = “47TSS(X“"X’)>
or, from (39), [div expr] = 41r58(x-~x'). (41)
Now (39) shows that div8 is a function only of the longitudinal
variables, so (41) gives
[div 6x, KKK] = 4w88(x—x ’) = —4w3~‘-*'(x—xQ.
Integrating With respect to avg, We get
[div @X,VX, = —41r8(X—-X'), (42)
there being no constant of integration since the field functions éx and
V; are made up of Waves of non-zero Wave length. From (4 2)and (39)
V‘3[Ux,T/1,] = 4118(x— x’).
Integrating With the help of formula (72) of § 38, We get
[Uxr-Vzﬂ] = —|X—X'|-1, <43)
there being no constant of integration or other terms not vanishing

at infinity on the right-hand side, because U,‘ and V; are made up of
Waves of non-zero Wave length. We have from (3 8)and (43)

[ErmVJE] = -[U" VJ = —(»"v1~—wZ-)IX—X'I'B~ <44)

We shall now obtain the Hamiltonian in terms of the A,, and B,,
variables. We have from the second of equations (3 0)

Similarly, from the first of equations (30),

Adding and dividing by —8w, we get
-.(s-.¢)-1 f (B, BH-i-AFTAP’) 033x
= -2».¢2 f k02(,4,kZ»k+,=I,,_k Atgk) @1316.

This is equalto HF given by (19), apart from an inﬁnite numerical
term. The formula (19)for HF already involves an arbitrary numerical
term, so we may take

HF = —(81r)"”1 I (B, BP-i-AMYAP’) daze: (45)

with an arbitrary numerical term, diﬁerent from that of (I9).

The Hamiltonian (4 5)can, of course, be used to give the Heisenberg
equations of motion, and the arbitrary numerical term in it does not
have any effect. One can easily check, using (31), (3 2)and (33), that

GAP/Elmo = [AWHF] = B“, } (46)
and aBH/awo = [B,, HF] = V214”,
agreeing with (2 9) and (1). It also gives the Schrodinger equation of

for a ket |P) representing a state in the Schrodinger picture. The
arbitrary numerical term here has the effect of changing 1P) by a
phase factor, which is not of physical importance.

We can decompose the expression (45) for HF- into a transverse
part HFT and a longitudinal part HFL. We have from (3 4)

f 3,3,. 613w = f (.@,+ U')(.@,+ (7') 43$
‘JL’ f .@,.@, (i325 +  U"U"d3x,
since the cross terms vanish on account of
f U=:%,.d3x§ =__ f U35’,.=*d3x = o
from (3 5). Similarly we have from (8)
J AQA,” d3x = I aifﬂaﬁ.” dam + f VwV” d3x,
with the cross terms vanishing again. Thus (4 5) becomes
HF = HFT-l-HFL,
with Hm. = (am-l f (.@,.e2,+.@4.8.@¢) d3x (4?)
and Hm = (87r)"'1 f (U'U'+V"8V"--B0BO-Aonéo’) 0532:. ‘ (48)

It should be noted that the term

in HFT can be transformed to

so this term is just the magnetic energy. Some further partial inte-
grations give

so (48) may be written
