#55. Permutations as dynamical variables

We shall now build up a general theory for a system containing n
similar particles when states with any kind of symmetry properties
are allowed, i.e. when there is no restriction to only symmetrical or
only antisymmetrical states. The general state now will not be sym-
metrical or antisymmetrical, nor will it be expressible linearly in
terms of symmetrical and antisymmetrical states when n > 2. This
theory will not apply directly to any particles occurring in nature,
but all the same it is useful for setting up an approximate treatment
for an assembly of electrons, as will be shown in § 58.

We have seen that each permutation P of the n particles is a linear
operator which can be applied to any ket for the assembly. Hence
we can regard P as a dynamical variable in our system of n particles.

212 SYSTEMS CONTAINING SEVERAL SIMILAR PARTICLES §55

There are n! permutations, each of which can be regarded as a
dynamical variable. One of them, P1 say, is the identical permutation,
which is equal t0 unity. The product of any two permutations is a
third permutation and hence any function of the permutations is
reducible to a linear function of them. Any permutation P has a
reciprocal P4 satisfying

PP*1 = P-IP = P; = 1.

A perlnutation P can be applied to a bra (X i for the assembly,
to give another bra, which we shall denote for the present by P(X |.
If P is applied to both factors of the product (XI Y), the product
must be unchanged, since it is just a number, independent of any
order of the particles. Thus

(P<XI)PIY>=<XIY>

showing that P(X| z (X IP-l (7)

Now P(X I is the conjugate imaginary of PIX) and is thus equal to
(X 1P, and hence from (7)
P z P-l. (8)
Thus a permutation is not in general a real dynamical variable, its
conjugate complex being equal to its reciprocal.
Any permutation of the numbers 1, 2, 3,..., n may be expressed in
the cyclic notation, e.g. with n = 8

Pa. == (143)(27)(58)(6)= (9)

in which each number is to be replaced by the succeeding number in
a bracket, unless it is the last in a bracket, when it is to be replaced
by the first in that bracket. Thus Pa changes the numbers 12345 6 78
into 47138625. The type of any permutation is specified by the
partition of the number n which is provided by the number of num-
bers in each of the brackets. Thus the type of Pa is specified by the
partition 8 = 3+2+2+ 1. Permutations of the same type, i.e. corre-
sponding to the same partition, we shall call  Thus, for
example, Pa in (9) is similar to

Pb = (871)(35)(45)(2)- (10)

The whole of the n! possible permutations may be divided into sets
of similar permutations, each such set being called a class. The per-
mutation P1 = 1 forms a class by itself. Any permutation is similar
to its reciprocal.

§55 PERMUTATIONS AS DYNXMICAL VARIABLES 213

When two permutations Pb, and Pb are similar, either of them F;
may be obtained by nlaking a certain permutation Pb in the other
Pb. Thus, in our example (9), (1 0 )we can take Pb, to be the permuta-
tion that changes 14327586 into 87135462,1'.e. the permutation

Pb = (18623)(475).
Different ways of Writing Pb and Pb in the cyclic notation would lead

to different PX7s. Any of these Pb’s applied to the product PblX>
would change it into B,.B,,|X>, i.e.

Hence B, == PbbPb Pb“, (11)

which expresses the condition for Pb and B, to be similar as an
algebraic equation. The existence of any Q satisfying (II) is sufﬁ-
cient to show that Pb and Pb are similar.
