#38. Motion in a central ﬁeld of force

An atom consists of a massive positively charged nucleus together
with a number of electrons moving round, under the inﬂuence of the
attractive force of the nucleus and their own mutual repulsions. An
exact treatment of this dynamical system is a very difﬁcult mathe-
matical problem. One can, however, gain some insight into the main
features of the system by making the rough approximation of regard-
ing each electron as moving independently in a certain central field
of force, namely that of the nucleus, assumed fixed, together with
some kind of average of the forces due to the other electrons. Thus
our present problem of the motion of a particle in a central field of
force forms a corner-stone in the theory of the atom.

Let the Cartesian coordinates of the particle, referred to a system
of axes with the centre of force as origin, be x, y, z and the corre-
sponding components of momentum p,, p,,, p,. The Hamiltonian,
Wit-h neglect of relativistic mechanics, will be of the form

H = 1f2m-(29i+29§+2@§)+T/, (57)
where V, the potential energy, is a function only of (x2+y2+z2). To
develop the theory it is convenient to introduce polar dynamical

variables. We introduce first the radius r, defined as the positive
square root r = (x2+y2+z2)*.

Its eigenvalues go from 0 to 0o. If we evaluate its P.B.s with p,, p,,,

and pa, we obtain, with the help of formula (32) of § 22,
____ 8r ___ a: ___ 1i __ g
[Tapx] "'_ 5;: "‘"‘ ;# [T129111 “'“ T’ [Thpz ‘H’ T’
the same as in the classical theory. TVe introduce also the dynamical
variable p, deﬁned by

Pr" I r-il(xpm+ypy+zpz)' (58

§38 MOTION IN A CENTRAL FIELD OF FORCE 153
Its P.B. With r is given by

rlrmr] = [Tfrﬁrl = [in wPxH/Pyirzpz]
= xlrjpxl+ylruzzvyl+zlrwzvzl
= x.:v/r-|-y.y/r+z.z/r = r.
Hence [@2913 = 1
or rpf-prr = 11%.

The commutation relation between 1" and p, is just the one for a
canonical coordinate and momentum, namely equation (10) of § 22.
This makes p,,. like the momentum conjugate to the r coordinate, but
it is not exactly equal to this momentum because it is not real, its
conjugate complex being

= (rp,.—3i%)r"1 = p,.— Ziﬁr“? (59)
Thus p,.--i?i¢"1 is real and is the true momentum conjugate to r.
The angular momentum In of the particle about the origin is given
by (22) and its magnitude k is given by (39). Since r and p, are
scalars, they commute With m, and therefore also With k.

We can express the Hamiltonian in terms of r, p,, and k. We have,

if Z denotes a sum over cyclic permutations of the sufﬁxes x, y, z,

This form for H is such that k commutes not only With H, as is
necessary since k is a constant of the motion, but also With every
‘dynamical variable occurring in H, namely w‘, p,,, and V, which is a

function of r. In consequence, a simple treatment becomes possible,
namely, we may consider an eigenstate of k belonging to an eigen-
value k’ and then we can substitute k’ for k in (6 0)and get a problem
in one degree of freedom r.

Let us introduce Schrodinger's representation with X, y, z diagonal.
Then pm, gay, p, are equal to the operators --'iﬁ 8/82.", Miﬁ 8/8y, -iﬁ 8/82
respectively. A state is represented by a wave function (Mxyzt) satis-
fying Schrodinger's wave equation ( 7) of § 2 7, which now reads, with
H given by (57),

We may pass from the Cartesian coordinates x,y,z to the polar
coordinates r, 6, g5 by means of the equations

w = rsinﬁcosqb,
y = rsinﬁsinqb, (62)
z = rcosél,

and may express the wave function in terms of the polar coordinates,
so that it reads MrQqBt). The equations (6 2)give the operator equation

which shows, on being compared wvith (58), that p, z —i% 8/8r. Thus
Schrodinger's wave equation reads, with the form (60) for H,

Here Io is a certain linear operator which, since it commutes with r
and 8/82", can involve only 6, qB, 8/86, and 8/8qS. From the formula

kUc-I-ti) = mZ-I-mg-l-mg, (64)

which comes from (39), and from (62) one can work out the form of

This operator is well known in mathematical physics. Its eigen-
functions are called spherical lmrmonics and its eigenvalues are
n(n+ 1) where n is an integer. Thus the theory of spherical har-
monics provides an alternative proof that the eigenvalues of k are

integral multiples of ti.

For an eigenstate of 1c belonging t0 the eigenvalue n1"? (n a non-
negative integer) the wave function will be of the form

i.e. from (65) 8,, is a spherical harmonic of order n. The factor W1

is inserted in (66) for convenience. Substituting ( 6 6) into (63), we
get as the equation for X

2m r2

If the state is a stationary state belonging to the energy value H’,
X will be of the form xm) = Xome-irrain

and (68) will reduce to

2 2
 
This equation may be used to determine the energy-levels H' cf the
system. For each solution X0 of (69), arising from a given n, there
will be 2n+l independent states, because there are 2n+1 indepen-
dent solutions of (67) corresponding to the 2n+1 different values
that a component of the angular momentum, m, say, can take on.
The probability of the particle being in an element of volume
dxdydz is proportional to IQMZdxdydz. With ip of the form ( 6 6) this
becomes r-2|X]2|S,,|2dxdydz. The probability of the particle being in
a spherical shell between r and r-j-dr is then proportional to lXlzdr.
It now becomes clear that, in solving equation ( 68) or (69), we must
impose a boundary condition on the function X at r = 0, namely the
function must be such that the integral to the origin I [Xlzdr is
0

   

convergent. If this integral were not convergent, the wave function
would represent a state for which the chances are infinitely in favour
of the particle being at the origin and such a state would not be
physically admissible.

The boundary condition at r = 0 obtained by the above considera-
tion of probabilities is, however, not sufficiently stringent. We get a
more stringent condition by verifying that the wave functionobtained
by solving the wave equation in polar coordinates (63) really satisfies
the wave equation in Cartesian coordinates (61). Let us take the case

156 ELEMENTARY APPLICATIONS § 33

of V .1 0, giving us the problem of the free particle. Applied t0 a
stationary state with energy H‘ = 0, equation (61) gives

v%=a (W)

where V2 is written for the Laplacian operator 82/8x2-1-82/8y24-89/8z2,
and equation (63) gives

(l 52 r k(k+%))¢ = 0. (v1)

r 55:5 7.22"“

A solution of (71) for 1c =1 0 is 1/1 r T'"1. This does not satisfy
(70), since,although Var-l vanishes for any ﬁnite value of r, its integral
through a volume containing the origin is —--4m' (as may be veriﬁed
by transforming this voiume integral to a surface integral by means
of Gauss's theorem), and hence

V2r""1 = -—-4w3(m)3(y)8(z). (72)

Thus not every solution of (7l) gives a solution of ('70), and more
generally, not every solution of (63) is a solution of (6l). We must
impose on the solution of (63) the condition that it shall not tend to
infinity as rapidly as 1W1 when r -+ O in order that, when substituted
into (61), it shall not give a 8 function on the right like the right-hand
side of (72). Only when equation (63)is supplemented with this condi-
tion does it become equivalent to equation (61). We thus have the
boundary condition n]; --:~ O or X e 0 as 1* --> 0.

There are also boundary conditions for the wave function at r = 0o.
If we are interested only in ‘closed’ states, i.e. states for which the
particle does not go oif to inﬁnity, we must restrict the integral to

infinity I {X(r)]2 d?" to be convergent. These closed states, however,
are not the only ones that are physically permissible, as we can also
have states in which the particle arrives from infinity, is scattered
by the central field of force, and goes oif to inﬁnity again. For these
states the wave function may remain finite as r e» o0. Such states will
be dealt with in Chapter VIII under the heading of collision problems.
In any case the wave function must not tend to infinity as r -> o0, or
it will represent a state that has no physical meaning.
