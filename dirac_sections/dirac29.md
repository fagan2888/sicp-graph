#29. Stationary states
We shall here deal with a dynamical system whose energy is con-
stant. Certain specially simple relations hold for this case., Equation
(6) can be integratedT to give
T x e-iHG-Jrﬂlﬁ

with the help of the initial condition that T = I for t = to. This
result substituted into (1) gives

|Pt> = e-=¢H<r-=@>/ﬁ11>:.>. <16)

which is the integral of Schrodinger's equation of motion (5), and

substituted into (10)it gives
t z eiH(t-io)Iﬁve-iH(£-lo)]ﬁ (17)

which is the integral of Heisenberg's equation of motion (11), H} being
now equal to H. Thus we have solutions of the equations of motion
in a simple form. However, these solutions are not of much practical
value, because of the diﬁculty involved in evaluating the operator
e-‘H(‘*‘°Vﬁ, unless H is particularly simple, and for practical purposes
one usually has to -fall back on Schrodinger's wave equation.

Let us consider a state of motion such that at time to it is an eigen-
state of the energy. The ket jPto) corresponding to it at this time
must be an eigenket of H. If H’ is the eigenvalue to which it belongs,

showing that {Pt} differs from IP25“) only by a phase factor. Thus
the state always remains an eigenstate of the energy, and further, it
does not vary with the time at all, since the direction of the ket |Pt)
does not vary with the time. Such a state is called a stationary state.
The probability for any particular result of an observation on it is
independent of the time when the observation is made. From our
assumption that the energy is an observable, there are sufficient
stationary states for an arbitrary state to be dependent on them.

The time-dependent wave function 5b(§t) representing a stationary
state of energy H’ will vary with time according to the law

‘I’ The integration can be carried out as though H were an ordinary algebraic
variable instead of a linear operator, because there is no quantity that does not
commute with H in the work.

and Schrodinger's Wave equation (7) for it reduces to
3160' = Helm) (19)

This equation merely asserts that the state represented by 1L0 is an
eigenstate-of H. We call a function tho satisfying (19) an eigenfunction
of H, belonging to the eigenvalue H’.

In the Heisenberg picture the stationary states correspond to ﬁxed
eigenvectors of the energy. We can set up a representation in which
all the basic vectors are eigenvectors of the energy and so correspond
to stationary statss in the Heisenberg picture. We call such a repre-
sentation a Heisenberg representation. The ﬁrst form of quantum
mechanics, discovered by Heisenberg in 1925, was in terms of a
representation of this kind. The energy is diagonal in the representa-
tion. Any other diagonal dynamical variable must commute with the
energy and is therefore a constant of the motion. The problem of
setting up a Heisenberg representation thus reduces to the problem
of ﬁnding a complete set of commuting observables, each of which
is a constant of the motion, and then making these observables
diagonal. The energy must be a function of these observables, from
Theorem 2 of § 19. It is sometimes convenient to take the energy
itself as one of them.

Let a denote the complete set of commuting observables in a
Heisenberg representation, so that the basic vectors are Written (of |,
1a”). The energy is a function of these observables a, say H = 3(a).
From (17) We get

Where H‘ = H (of) and H == H (of). The factor (a' Ivla") on the right-
hand side here is independent of t, being an element of the matrix
representing the ﬁxed Linear operator v. Formula (20) shows how the
Heisenberg matrix elements of any Heisenberg dynamical variable
vary with time, and it makes v, satisfy the equation of motion (11),
as is easily veriﬁed. The variation given by (20) is simply periodic

with the frequency

depending only on the energy difference of the two stationary states
to which the matrix element refers. This result is closely connected
