#66. Relativistic treatment 0f a particle

THE theory we have been building up so far is essentially a non-
relativistic one. We have been working all the time with one par-
ticular Lorentz frame of reference and have set up the theory as an
analogue of the classical non-relativistic dynamics. Let us now try
to make the theory invariant under Lorentz transformations, so that
it conforms to the special principle of relativity. This is necessary in
order that the theory may apply to high-speed particles. There is no
need to make the theory conform to general relativity, since general
relativity is required only when one is dealing with gravitation, and
gravitational forces are quite unimportant in atomic phenomena.

Let us see how the basic ideas of quantum theory can be adapted
to the relativistic point of view that the four dimensions of space-
time should be treated on the same footing. The general principle
of superposition of states, as given in Chapter I, is a relativistic
principle, since it applies to ‘states’ with the relativistic space-time
meaning. However, the general concept of an observable does not ﬁt
in, since an observable may involve physical things at widely separated
points at one instant of time. In consequence, if one works with a
general representation referring to any complete set of commuting
observables, the theory cannot display the symmetry between space
and time required by relativity. In relativistic quantum mechanics
one must be content with having one representation which displays
this symmetry. One then has the freedom to transform to another
representation referring to a special Lorentz frame of reference if it
is useful for a particular calculation.

For the problem of a single particle, in order to display the syn).-
metry between space and time we must use the Schrodinger repre-
sentation. Let us put x1, x2, x3 for X, y, z, and x0 for ct. The time-
dependent wave function then appears as 914x20 x1x2X,) and provides
us with a basis for treating the four X's on the same footing.

We shall use relativistic notation, writing the four X's as x”
(u = 0, l, 2, 3). Any space-time vector with four components which
transform under Lorentz transformations like the four elements d411,,
will be written like a, with a lower Greek suffiX. We may raise the

suffix according to the rules
q," Z. a0, a} = -—a1, a2 z —a2, a3 == —_}a3. (1)

The a, are called the contravariant components of the vector a, and
the a,“ the covariant components. Two vectors a}, and b}, have a
Lorentz-invariant scalar product

QP""=O fOfp-#V.
With its help the rules (1)connecting covariant and contravariant
components may be written
a" = gPwav.

In the Schrodinger representation the momentum, whose com-
ponents will now be written p1, p2, p3 instead of Pm, p” P» i3 equal
to the operator

p, = "iﬁéi/Sx, (r= 1, 2,3). (3)
Now the four operators 61/62:}, form the covariant components of a
4-vector whose contravariant components are written ﬁ/ﬁxl“. So to
bring (3) into a relativistic theory, we must first write it with its

suffixes balanced, p, z m 8/53?’

and then extend it to the complete 4-vector equation
p’, 1 "Hi ﬁ/ﬁzzsl“. (4)

We thus have to introduce a new dynamical variable p0, equal to
the operator 11% 3/8x0. Since it forms a 4-vector when combined with the
momenta 19,, it must have the physical meaning of the energy of the
particle divided by c. We can proceed to develop the theory treating
the four p's on the same footing, like the four afs.

In the theory of the electron that will be developed here we shall
have to introduce a further degree of freedom describing an internal
motion of the electron. The wave function will thus have to involve
a further variable besides the four X'S.
