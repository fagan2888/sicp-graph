#46. Transitions caused by a perturbation independent of the
time

The perturbation method of § 44 is still valid when the perturbing
energy V does not involve the time t explicitly. Since the total
Hamiltonian H in this case does not involve t explicitly, we could
now, if desired, deal with the system by the perturbation method of
§ 43 and find its stationary states. Whether this method would be
convenient or not would depend on what we want to find out about
the system. If what we have to calculate makes an explicit reference
to the time, eg. if we have to calculate the probability of the system
being in a certain state at one time when we are given that it is in a
certain state at another time, the method of § 44 would be the more
convenient one.

Let us see what the result (24) for the transition probab‘ lity becomes
when V does not involve t explicitly and let us take to = 0 to simplify
the writing. The matrix element (a" IVIQ’) is now independent of t,

§45 TRANSITION PROBABILITIES 179

If E" differs appreciably from E’ this transition probability is small
and remains s0 for all values of t. This result is required by the law
of the conservation of energy. The total energy H is constant and
hence the proper-energy E (i.e. the energy with neglect of the part
V due to the perturbation), being approximately equal to H, must
be approximately constant. This means that if E initially has the
numerical value E‘, at any later time there must be only a small
probability of its having a numerical value differing considerably
from E'.

On the other hand, when the initial state a’ is such that there exists
another state a" having the same or very nearly the same proper-
energy E, the probability of a transition to the final state 0c" may be
quite large. The case of physical interest now is that in which there
is a continuous range of final states a” having a continuous range of
proper-energy levels E passing through the value E' of the proper-
energy of the initial state. The initial state must not be one of the
continuous range of final states, but may be either a separate discrete
state or one of another continuous range of states. We shall now have,
remembering the rules of § 18 for the interpretation of probability
amplitudes with continuous ranges of states, that, with Pbzfu”)
having the value (36), the probability of a transition to a final state
within the small range a" to of-l-da” will be Pmfot") don" if the initial
state a’ is discrete and will be proportional to this quantity if a‘ is
one of a continuous range.

We may suppose that the a's describing the final state consist of
E together with a number of other dynamical variables ,8, so that we
have a representation like that of § 43 for the degenerate case. (The
He, however, need have no meaning for the initial state of.) We shall
suppose for definiteness that the ,8’s have only discrete eigenvalues.
The total probability of a transition to a final state a" for which the
,8’s have the values H’ and E has any value (there will be a strong
probability of its having a value near the initial value E’) will now
be (or be proportional to)

Thus the total probability up to time t of a transition to a ﬁnal state
for which the HS have the values ,8” is proportional to t. There is
therefore a deﬁnite probability GOﬁﬁﬁiﬁli, or probability per unit time,
for the transition process under consideration, having the value

2wh*1|<E’B”|V|a’>|”. (39)

It is proportional to the square of the modulus of the matrix element,
associated With this transition, of the perturbing energy.
If the matrix element <E',B”|V|cx'> is small compared with other

matrix elements of V, We must work with the more accurate formula
(26). We have from (35)

For E close to E’, only the ﬁrst term inthe integrand here gives rise
to a transition probability of physical importance and the second
term may be discarded. Using this result in (2 6) We get

§46 TRANSITION PROBABILITIES 131

In order that the approximations used in deriving (3 9)and (40)may
be valid, the time t must be not too small and not too large. It must
be large compared with the periods of the atomic system in order that
the approximate evaluation of the integral (37) leading to the result
(38) may be valid, While it must not be excessively large or else the
general formula (24) or (26) will break down. In fact one could make
the probability (3 8) greater than unity by taking t large enough. The
upper limit to t is fixed by the condition that the probability (24) or
(26), or t times (39) or (40), must be small compared with unity. There
is no difficulty in t satisfying both these conditions simultaneously
provided the perturbing energy V is sufficiently small.
