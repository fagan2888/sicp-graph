#72. The fine-structure of the energy-levels of hydrogen

We shall now takethe case ofthe hydrogen atom, for which A, = e/o",
and work out its energy-levels, given by the eigenvalues H’ of H.
The equation (H '——H )1) = O which deﬁnes these eigenvalues, when
written in terms of representatives in the representation discussed

in which consecutive values of s differ by unity though these values
need not be integers. Substituting these expressions for f and g in

The boundary condition at r = O requires that Till!“ and 101,61, ~+ 0 as
r—>~ O, so from (46)f and g -> O as 2' + O. Thus the series (49) must
terminate on the side of small s. If s0 is the minimum value ofs for
which c, and 0; do not both vanish, We obtain from (50), by putting
s = so and 08F, = 01W, = O,

Since the boundary condition requires that the minimum value of s
shall be greater than zero, we must take

80 = +~/'(9'2—~@¢2)-
To investigate the convergence of the series (49)We shall determine

the ratio cs/csﬂ for large s. Equation (5 l)and the second of equations
(50)give approximately, when s is large,

a2 0s = a0;
and s08 = 0,_,/@+@;_,/a,.
Hence cs/csq = iZ/as.

The series (49)will therefore converge like

or 02”“. This result is similar to that obtained in $39 and allows us
to infer, as in §39, that all values of H' are permissible for which a
is pure imaginary, i.e. from (47), for Which. H' > mc2, While for
H’ < mcZ We take a to be positive and then find that only those
values of H’ are permissible for which the series (49) terminate on
the side of large s.
If the series (49) terminate with the terms c, and 0;, so that

03,1 = 0;, = O, We obtain from (50) with s+1 substituted for s

cs/ag-l-cs/a =- 0.

These two equations are equivalent on account of (47). When com-
bined with (51), they give

The s here, which specifies the last term in the series, must be greater
than so by some integer not less than zero. Calling this integer ‘n,

This formula gives the discrete energy-levels of the hydrogen
spectrum and was first obtained by Sommerfeld working with Bohr's
orbit theory. There are two quantum numbers n and j involved, but
owing to 0:2 being very small the energy depends almost entirely on
n+jj|. Values of n and lj! that give the same n-l-lj] give rise to a
set of energy-levels lying very close to one another, and to the
energy-level given by the non-relativistic formula (80) of § 39 with
.5- = n-l- I jl, apart from the constant term mcz.

We used equations ( 5 3 )by combining them with (51), but this does
not make full use of ( 5 3 )since the coefficients of c, and of, in (51)may
both vanish. In this case We get, multiplying the first coefficient by
a, and the second by a and adding,

aﬂcal-l-aga-i-Qalagj = 0.
Thusj must be negative in this case. With the help of (44)and (4 7)
We get further

with j negative thus needs further investigation to see whether the
conditions (53) are then fulﬁlled.

With n = O, the maximum value of s is the same as the minimum,
so equations (53) with so substituted for s should agree with (52).
Now (55)gives, from (44) and (47),

__1__ _____: §f(1____\/(j2f0¢2)), i _1_ z 171E i,

so the ﬁrst of equations (53)with so substituted for s gives

This agrees with the second of equations (52) only if is positive.

We can conclude that, for n = O, j must be a positive integer, while
for the other values of n all non-Zero integral values of j are allowed.
