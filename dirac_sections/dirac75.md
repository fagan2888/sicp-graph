#75. Relativistic form of the quantum conditions

The theory of the preceding section has relativistic field equations,
namely equations (l). To establish that the theory is fully relativistic
we n1ust show further that the P.B. relations are relativistic. This is
not at all evident from the form (16) in which they are written in
terms of Fourier components. We shall obtain a relativistic form for
the P.B.s by working out [A Mac), A,,(x')] with x and x’ any two points
in space-time. We must first, however, study a certain invariant

singular function that esists in space-time.
The function 8m” as“) is evidently Lorentz invariant. It vanishes

everywhere except on the light-cone with the origin as vertex, i.e. the
three-dimensional space as}, an“ = 0. This light-cone consists of two
distinct parts, afuturepart, for which x0 > 0, and apastp art, for which
x0 < 0. The function which equals 3m“ x12‘) on the future part of the
light-cone and --5(xp as“) on the past part of the light-cone is also
Lorentz invariant. This function, equal to 8w}, x#)x0/|x0|, plays
an important role in the dynamical theory of fields, so we introduce
a special notation for it. We define

2(2) = 25(21,.w“)2@/l20f- <22)
This definition gives a meaning to the function A applied to any
4-vector. With the help of (9) of § 15, we can express 8w” x3) in the

A(cc) is deﬁned to have the value zero at the origin, and evidently

Let us make a Fourier analysis of A(:c). Using d4x t0 denote
dxodscldxgdxa and d3x to denote dx,dx2dx3 We have, for any 4-

By introducing polar coordinates |X|, O, g6 in the three-dimensional
x1 x2 x3 space, With the direction of the three-dimensional part of 7a,,
as pole, We get

Thus the Fourier analysis gives the same function again, with the
coefficient 411-22’. Interchanging k and x in (23), We get

Aw) x “@4172. f A(Ic)e"”°-"= m. (24)

Some of the important properties of A(x) can easily be deduced
from its Fourier resolution. In the first place equation (24) shows that
A(a:) can be resolved into Waves all travelling with the velocity of
light. To get an equation for this result We apply the operator III to
both sides of (24), thus

Baa) = --i/41r2. f A(ic)[]eik-“ (1% = i/41r2. f t, kHA(k)e““-“=d4k.
Now k“ kPA(k).= O, and hence
Elana) = o. (25)

This equation holds throughout space-time. We can give a meaning

and transforming it t0 a three-dimensional surface integral by Gauss's
theorem. Equation (25)informs us that the three-dimensional surface
integral always vanishes.

The function A(a:) vanishes all over the three-dimensional surface
x0 = 0. Let us determine the value of 8A(x)/6x0 on this surface. It
evidently vanishes everywhere except at the point x1 r: x2 = x3 = 0,
where it has a singularity which can be evaluated as follows. Differ-
entiating both sides of (24) with respect to mo, we get

Putting x0 = 0 on both sides here, we get.

Thus the ordinary 8 singularity, with the coefficient 411-, appears at
the point x, = :02 = x3 == 0.

Let us now evaluate [A,,(a:), A,,(x’)]. We have from (3), (16), and (17)

The k0 here; is defined to be equal to |k| and is thus always positive.
By putting -k for k in the second part of the integrand, one finds
that (27)is equal to the four-dimensional integral

a result Which shows that the P.B. relations are invariant under
Lorentz transformations.

The formula (28) means that the potentials at two points in space-
time always commute unless the line joining the two points is a null
line, i.e. the track of a light-ray. The formula is consistent with the
ﬁeld equations IIIAPM) = 0, because |:| applied to the right-hand
side gives zero, from (25).
