#18. Probability amplitudes

Representations are of great importance in the physical interpreta-
tion of quantum mechanics as they provide a convenient method for
obtaining the probabilities of observables having given values. In
$12 we obtained the probability of an observable having any speci-
f1ed value for a given state and in § l3 we generalized this result
and obtained the probability of a set of commuting observables
simultaneously having speciﬁed values for a given state. Let us now
apply this result to a complete set of commuting observables, say the
set of §’s which we have been dealing with already. According to
formula (51) of § l3, the probability of each 5,. having the value E;
for the state corresponding -to the normalized ket vector {m} is

P-.s;...§;. = <xlsalsa5szsa---5e..s;.lx>— (50)

§13 PROBABILITY AMPLITUDES 73

If the 51s all have discrete eigenvalues, We can use (35) With 12 = u
and no integrals, and get

= |<€i-~-€ltl$>l2- (51)

We thus get the simple result that the probability 0f the $39 having the
values g?’ is just the square 0f the modulus 0f the appropriate coordinate
of the normalized ket vector corresponding to the state concerned.

If the §’s do not all have discrete eigenvalues, but if, say, €1:"!§v
have discrete eigenvalues and 5,, +1,” 5,, have continuous eigenvalues,,
then to get something physically signiﬁcant We must obtain the
probability of each 5,. (r = 1 ,.., v) having a speciﬁed value 5,’. and each
f8 (s = o+1,..,U) lying in a speciﬁed small range E; to ﬁ-l-drf} For
this purpose We must replace each factor 8,5,5; in (50) by a factor x3,
Which is that function of the observable f8 Which is equal to unity
for E3 Within the range 5f, to 534g; and zero otherwise. Proceeding
as before with the help of (35), We obtain for this probability

1351...§;dEL+1~-d§;= I<rfi---éltl=v>lgdéi+l--d§it~ (52)

Thus in every case the probability distribution of values for the $8 is
given by the square of the modulate of the representative of the norma-
lized ket vector corresponding to the state concerned.

The numbers Which form the representative of a normalized ket
(or bra) may for this reason be called probability amplitudes. The
square of the modulus of a probability amplitude is an ordinary
probability, or a probability per unit range for those variables that
have continuous ranges of values.

We may be interested in a state Whose corresponding ket Irv) cannot
be normalized. This occurs, for example, if the state is an eigenstadie
of some observable belonging to an eigenvalue lying in a range of
eigenvalues. The forznula (51) or (52) can then still be used to give
the relative probability of the Ks having speciﬁed values or having
values lying in speciﬁed small ranges, i.e. it Will give correctly the
ratios of the probabilities for different §”s. The numbers (éi-uéjdiv)
may then be called relative probability amplitudes.

74 REPRESEXTATIONS § 18

The representation for Which the above results hold is characterized
by the basic vectors being simultaneous eigenvectors of all the §’s.
It may also be characterized by the requirement that each of the Es
shall be represented by a diagonal matrix, this condition being easily
seen to be equivalent to the previous one. The latter characterization
is usually the more convenient one. For brevity, We shall formulate
it as each of the Es ‘being diagonal in the representation’.

Provided the Es form a complete set of commuting observables,
the representation is completely determined by the characterization,
apart from arbitrary phase factors in the basic vectors. Each basic bra
<§1...§.L,f may be Inultiplied by ail’, Where y’ is any real function of
the variables $1,“, 5;, Without changing any of the conditions Which
the representation has to satisfy, i.e. the condition that the §’s are
diagonal or that the basic vectors are simultaneous eigenvectors of
the Ks, and the fundamental properties of the basic vectors (34) and
(35). With the basic bras changed in this Way, the representative
(QUJEQIP) of a ket |P> gets multiplied by e15", the representative
(Q|§1...§;,> of a bra (Q! gets multiplied by e"'*"?" and the representa-
tive <§1...§.‘,'_,|@]§{...§{1> of a linear operator o: gets multiplied by e'*7(>""°’").
The probabilities or relative probabilities (51), (52) are, of course,
unaltered.

The probabilities that one calculates in practical problems in
quantum mechanics are nearly alWays obtained from the squares
of the moduli of probability amplitudes or relative probability ampli-
tudes. Even When one is interested only in the probability of an
incomplete set of commuting observables having speciﬁed values, it
is usually necessary first to make the set a complete one by the
introduction of some extra commuting observables and to obtain
the probability of the complete set having speciﬁed values (as the
square of the modulus of a probability amplitude), and then to sum
or integrate over all possible wralues of the extra observables. A
Inore direct application of formula (51) of § l3 is usually not
practicable.

To introduce a representation in practice

(i) We look for observables Which we Would like to have diagonal,
either because we are interested in their probabilities or for
reasons of mathematical simplicity;

(ii) We must see that they all commute—a necessary condition
since diagonal matrices alWays commute;

§18 PROBABILITY AMPLITUDES 75

(iii) We then see that they form a complete commuting set, atld
if not we add some more commuting observables to them to
make them into a complete commuting set;

(iv) We set up an orthogonal representation with this complete
commuting set diagonal.

The representation is then completely determined except for the
arbitrary phase factors. For most purposes the arbitrary phase
factors are unimportant and trivial, so that we may count the
representation as being completely determined by the observables
that are diagonal in it. This fact is already implied in our notation,
since the only indication in a representative of the representation to
which it belongs are the letters denoting the observables that are
diagonal.

It may be that me are interested in two representations for the
same dynainical system. Suppose that in one of them the complete
set of commuting observables §1,...,§,, are diagonal and the basic
bras are (53.5; and in the other the complete set of commuting
observables 171,...,v7,,, are diagonal and the basic bras are <v;;’,_...17§,,|.
A ket {P> will now have the turo representatives <§;...§.j,lP) and
(q1...17§,,]P>. If $1,", 5,, have discrete eigenvalues and §,,H,..,§,, have
continuous eigenvalues and if 7713;.’ 1b, have discrete eigenvalues and
17x w“, 17w have continuous eigenvalues, we get from (35)

These are the transformation equations which give one representative
of 1P) in terms of the other. They showv that either representative
is expressible linearly in terms of the other, with the quantities

<121---'0I..-I€i---€;>, <€i~~éitlwi~~vlv> (55)

as coefficients. These quantities are called the transformation func-
tions. Similar equations ‘may be written dowh to connect the two
representatives of a bra vector or of a linear operator. The trans-
formation functions (55) are in every case the means wvhioh enable
one to pass from one representative to the other. Each of the

76 REPRESENTATIONS §18

transformation functions is the conjugate complex of the other, and
they satisfy the conditions

and the corresponding conditions with §’s and 175s interchanged, as
may be verified from (35) and (34) and the corresponding equations
for the vfs.

Transformation functions are examples of probability amplitudes
or relative probability amplitudes. Let us take the case when all the
<f’s and all the q's have discrete eigenvalues. Then the basic ket
{v;;...17§,,> is normalized, so that its representative in the {lrepresenta-
tion, (§1...§.§,-|~q_i,...-q;,>, is a probability amplitude for each set of values
for the §”s. The state to which these probability amplitudes refer,
namely the state corresponding to |171...17;,,>, iS characterized by the
condition that a simultaneous measurement of q1,..., 17w is certain to
lead to the results q1,...,17.10. Thus |<§i...§§,]1;_§_...17;,>|2 is the proba-
bility of the ﬁ-"s having the values ﬁnf; for the state for which the
q's certainly have the values 171...v;§,,. Since

I<€i---€LI17i-~-WZQ>I2 = |<ﬂi---17Zvl§i--~§L>l2,

we have the theorem of reciprocity —the probability cf the 53s having
the values $'for the state for which the vfs certainly have the values n’
is equal to the probability cf the vfs having the values w)’ for the state for
which the fie certainly have the values 5’. l

If all the vfs have discrete eigenvalues and some of the §’s have
continuous eigenvalues, ]<.;'-'1...§;,[1q’1...17;,>|2 still gives the probability
distribution of values for the 5s for the state for which the vfs cer-
tainly have the values 1;’. If some of the vfs have continuous eigen-
values, Ivqiunqiv) is not normalized and |<§1...§.',,|17;_...v;§,,>|2 then gives
only the relative probability distribution of values for the $3 for the
state for which the vfs certainly have the values n’.
