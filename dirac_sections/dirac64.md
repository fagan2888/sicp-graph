#64. Emission, absorption, and scattering of radiation

We can now determine directly the coefficientsof emission, absorp-
tion, and scattering of radiation by substituting in the formulas of

§64 IEMISSION, rXB-SbRPTION, AND SCATTERING OF RADIATION 245

Chapter VIII the values for the matrix elements given by (75), (76),
and (7 7).

For determining the emission probability We can use formula
(56) of $53. This shows that for an atom in a state a“ the proba-
bility per unit time per unit solid angle of its spontaneously emitting
a photon and dropping to a state a’ of lower energy is

Z c, §(,W),<@|w,|@"> . (v8)

Now the energy and momentum of a photon of frequency v are
W = hv, P = hv/c.
Again, from the Heisenberg law (2 0) of § 29,
(a'[:15l|cx°> = ——-2w‘iv(aooz’)<on']wlla0),

v(m°a’) being the frequency connected With transitions from state ca“
to state a’, which in the present case is just the frequency v of the
emitted radiation. These results substituted in ( 7 8) make the emisl-
sion coefficient reduce to

(Envy;

ha?’

To obtain the rate of emission of energy per unit solid angle for a

specified polarization, We must multiply this by hv. This gives for
the total rate of emission of energy in all directions

which is in agreement With expression (3 4)of§ 45 and justifies Heisexr
berg's assumption for the interpretation of his matrix elements.

In the same Way the absorption coefficient, given by formula

(59) of § 53, becomes for photons

This absorption coefficient refers to an incident beam of one photon
crossing unit area per unit time per unit energy range. If we take
one per unit frequency range instead of energy range, as is usual
when dealing With radiation, the absorption coefficient becomes

This result is the same as (32) of § 45, if We substitute for the E,
there the energy kv of a single photon. Thus,the elementary theory

246 THEORY OF RADIATION §64

(f §45, in which the radiation ﬁeld is treated as an external perturba-
tion, gives the correct value for the absorption coeﬁicient.

This agreement between the elementary theory and the present
theory could be inferred from general arguments. The two theories
differ only in that the ﬁeld quantities all commute with one another
in the elementary theory and satisfy definite commutation relations
in the present theory, and this difference becomes unimportant for
strong ﬁelds. Thus the two theories must give the same absorption
and emission when strong fields are concerned. Since both theories
give the rate of absorption proportional to the intensity of the inci-
dent beam, the agreement must hold also for weak ﬁelds in the case of
absorption. In the same way the stimulated part of the emission in the
present theory must agree with the emissionin the elementary theory.

Let us now consider scattering. The direct scattering coefﬁcient is
given by formula (38) of $50. Such scattering of photons will not be
accompanied by any change of state of the atom on account of the
factor 3a,,» in the expression for the matrix element (77). Thus the
ﬁnal energy W‘ of the photon will equal its initial energy W”. The
scattering coefﬁcient now reduces to

e“/m9c4 .. (P10)?

This is the same as that given by classical mechanics for the scattering
of radiation by a free electron. We thus see that the direct scatter-
ing of radiation by an electron in an atom is independent of the atom
and is correctly given by the classical theory. This result, it should
be remembered, holds only provided the wavelength of the radiation
is large compared with the dimensions of the atom.

The direct scattering is a mathematical concept and cannot be
separated out experimentally from the total scattering, given by
formula (44) of§ 51. Let us see what this total scattering is in the
case of photons. We must be careful in our application of formula
(44) of § 51. The .summation g in this formula may be considered as

representing the contribution to the scattering of double transitions
consisting of transitions ﬁrstly from the initial state to state k and
secondly from state k to the ﬁnal state. The ﬁrst transition may be
an absorption of the incident photon and the second an emission of
the required scattered photon, but it is also possible for the first
transition to be the emission and the second the absorption. It is
clear from the general nature of the method used for deriving formula

§64 EMISSION, ABSORPTION, AND SCATTERING OF RADIATION 247

(44) of § 51 that both these kinds of double transitions must be in-
cluded in the summation Z when this formula is applied t0 photons,
k

although only the ﬁrst of them appears in the actual derivation given
in § 51, as the possibility of the particle being created or annihilated

was not taken into account there.

We use zero, single prime, and double prime to refer to the initial,
ﬁnal, and intermediate states of the atom respectively, and zero and
single prime to refer to the absorbed and emitted photons respec-
tively. Then, for the double transition of absorption followed by
emission, we must take for the matrix elements

<klVlp°a°>, <P"@¢'|V|7¢>
of the formula (44) of § 51
<kIVIP°Q¢°> = (H"IHQIP°I°<>~<°>, (IYO/IVIK) = <1)’ '<1’|HQ|@¢">-

Also E'--Ek == hv°+HP(oz0)-—HP(cz") = k[v°-v(a”a°)],

where hv(a”a°) = HP(cx")——HP(oa°).

Similarly, for the double transition of emission followed by absorption
we must take

<klVlp°a°> t <P’I’<==”IHQI<><°>, <p’@’lVI1~'j = <dlffqlp°l°af>
and
Ea-Ek = hVO-l- HP(o¢°)——HP(o:”)—hVO—hV' = --h[v’+v(cz"a°)],

there being now two photons, of frequencies v0 and v’, in existence
for the intermediate state. Substituting in (44) of § 51 the values of

the matrix elements given by (75), (76), and ('77), we get for the
scattering coefficient

This gives the scattering coefficient in the form of the effective
area that a photon has to hit per unit solid angle of scattering. It is
known as the Iframers-Heisenberg dispersion formula, having been first
obtained by these authors from analogies with the classical theory
of dispersion.

The fact that the various terms in (82) can be combined to give
the result (85) justifies the assumption made in deriving formula (44)
of § 51, that the matrix elements (p’<x'|V|p"o¢"> of the interaction
energy are of the second order of smallness compared with the
(p?! [V]1c> ones, at any rate when the scattered particles are photons.
