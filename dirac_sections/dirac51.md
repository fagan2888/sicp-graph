#51. Dispersive scattering

We shall now determine the scattering when the incident particle
is capable of being absorbed, that is, when our unperturbed system
of scatterer plus particle has closed stationary states with the particle
absorbed. The,existence of these closed states for the unperturbed
system will be found to have a considerable effect on the scattering
for the perturbed system, and indeed an effect that depends very
much on the energy of the incident particle, giving rise to the pheno-
menon of dispersion in optics when the incident particle is taken to
be a photon.

We use a representation for which the basic kets correspond to
the stationary states of the unperturbed system, as was the case with
the p-representation of the preceding section. We take these station-
ary states to be the states (p’oc') for which the particle has a definite
momentum p’ and the scatterer is in a definite state a’, together with
the closed states, k say, which form a separate discrete set, and
assume that these states are all independent and orthogonal. This
assumption is not accurate when the particle is an electron or atomic
nucleus, since in this case for an absorbed state k the particle will
still certainly be somewhere, so that one would expect to be able to
expand |Zc> in terms of the eigenkets lxh’) of x, y, z, and the ofs,
and hence also in terms of the ip’oi’>’s. On the other hand, when the
particle is a photon it “will no longer exist for the absorbed states,
which are then certainly independent of and orthogonal to the states
( p11’) for which the particle does exist. Thus the assumption is valid
in this case, which is an important practical one.

Since we are concerned with scattering, we must still deal with
stationary states of the whole system. We shall now, however, have
to work to the second order of accuracy, so that we cannot use merely

the ﬁrst-order equation (3), but must use also (4). Equation (3 )
becomes, When Written in terms of representatives in our present
representation,

(W'-~W)<POL'I1> = (Drill/Wk.
(E'—~Ez,=)<kll> = (kW/IO),

Where W’ is the function of E’ and the a"s given by (18)and EA, is the
energy of the stationary state 1c of the unperturbed system. Similarly,
equation (4) becomes

(W'--W)<1M'l2>= (POJIVID,
(E'-~*E:,)<7@I2> I <7¢IV|1>-

} (39)

) 

Expanding the right-hand sides by matrix multiplication, We get

The ket |0> is still given by (19), so (39) may be mitten

(E’-"Ek)<7<=l1> = 7@%<7<=iV|P°@¢°>- (43)

We may assume that the matrix elements (Ic'lV|Zc"> of V vanish,
since these matrix elements are not essential to the phenomena under
investigation, and if they did not vanish it Would mean simply that
the absorbed states k had not been suitably chosen. We shall further
assume that the matrix elements (p116 I Vfpﬁx") are of the second order
of smallness When the matrix elements <ic'lV[p”a”>, <p'o¢’[V|lc”) are
taken to be of the ﬁrst order of smallness. This assumption will be
justiﬁed for the case of photons in§ 64. We now have from (4 3 )and
( 42 )that (M1) is of the ﬁrst order of smallness, provided E’ does not
lie near one of the discrete set of energy-levels Ek, and (poﬂl) is of
the second order. The value of (pd |2> to the second order Will thus
be given, from the ﬁrst of equations (41), by

(W'~—"’)<P@¢’I2> = 71*  <Pw’|VV¢"><?<>”|VlP°d°>/(E'—Ez.=~)-

The total correction in the wave function t0 the second order, namely
(paﬂl) plus (pa'|2>, therefore satisﬁes

(W'—W){<po=’ll>+<po='l2>}
= h"{<P<x’lT/IP°@°>+ g1 ow’|Vlk><l<=lVlp°a°>/(E’—Ek)}-

This equation is of the type (23), provided a’ is such that W’ > mc2,
which means that a’ as a ﬁnal state for the scatterer is not incon-
sistent with the law of conservation of energy. ‘We can therefore infer
from the general result (37) that the scattering coefficient is

The scattering may now be considered as composed of two parts,
a part that arises from the matrix element <p'a’lV|p°o¢") of the per-
turbing energy and a part that arises from the matrix elements
<p’@¢’|V|k) and <ic|V[p°o¢”>. The first part, which is the same as our
previously obtained result (38), may be called the direct scattering.
The second part may be considered as arising from an absorption of
the incident particle into some state k, followed immediately by a
re-emission in a different direction, and is like the transitions through
an intermediate state considered in $44. The fact that we have to
add the two terms before taking the square of the modulus denotes
interference between the two kinds of scattering. There is no experi-
mental way of separating the two kinds, the distinction between
them being only mathematical.
