#20. Developments in notation

The theory of representations that we have developed provides a
general system for labelling kets and bras. Ina representation in which
the complete set of commuting observables $1,“, 5,, are diagonal any
ket |P) mill have a representative <§1...§;,|P), or <$'|P> for brevity.
This representative is a deﬁnite function of the variables 5’, say M5’).
The function d: then determines the ket IP) completely, so it may be
used to label this ket, to replace the arbitrary label P. In symbols,
if <s'|P> = m’) } cw
W6 put |P> = M5».
We must put IP) equal to |<,!1(§)> and not ]¢(§’)>, since it does not
depend on a particular set of eigenvalues for the Fs, but only on the
form of the function 5b.

With f(§) any function of the observables §,_,...,§u, f(§)|P> will
have as its representative

<E’|f(€)lP> =f(€’)¢(§’)-
Thus according to (60) we put

f(€)iP> = lf(€)¢(€)>-
With the help of the second of equations (60) we now get

f (€)I¢(E)> = If(€)¢(€)>- (51)

This is a general result holding for any functions f and 1b of the §’s,
and it shows that the vertical line l is not necessary with the new
notation for a ket—either side of (61) may be written simply as
_f(§):,b(§)>. Thus the rule for the new notation becomes:—

if <e1P> = m’) } (6,)
W6 Put IP> = $05))
We may further shorten 511(5)) to $>, leaving the variables 5 under-
stood, if no ambiguity arises thereby.

The ket #5)) may be considered as the product of the linear

operator 3M5) with a lazet which is denoted simply by ) without a
label. We call the ket ) the standard ket. Any ket whatever can be

80 REPRESENTATIONS § 20

expressed as a function 0f the §’s multiplied into the standard ket.
For example, taking (P)in (62) t0 be the basic ket I5”), we ﬁnd

I56 = 8£1g;."8§l?£;8(€1?+1~m§$+1)"8(§1£h_§3)> (63)
in the case when $1,", 5,, have discrete eigenvalues and §.,,+1,.., 5,, have
continuous eigenvalues. The standard ket is characterized by the
condition that its representative (£1) is unity over the whole domain
of the variable g’, as may be seen by putting gb =~ l in (62).

A further contraction may be made in the notation, namely to
leave the symbol ) for the standard ket understood. A ket is then
written simply as 1/45), a function of the observables i. A function
of the §’s used in this way to denote a ket is called a wave functionj"
The system of notation provided by wave functions is the one usually
used by most authors for calculations in quantum mechanics. In
using it one should remember that each wave function is understood
to have the standard ket multiplied into it on the right, which
prevents one from multiplying the wave function by any operator
on the right. Wave functions can be multiplied by operators only on
the left. This distinguishes them from ordinary functions of the §’s,
which are operators and can be multiplied by operators on either the
left or the right. A wave function is just the representative of a ket
expressed as a function of the observables f, instead of eigenvalues 5'
for those observables. The square of its modulus gives the proba-
bility (or the relative probability, if it is not normalized) of the ES
having specified values, or lying in specified small ranges, for the
corresponding state.

The new notation for bras may be developed in the same way as
for kets. A bra (Q! whose representative (Ql?) is q5(§’) we write
<<ﬁ(§)[. With this notation the conjugate imaginary to Ic/dﬁ) is
{#5)}. Thus the rule that we have used hitherto, that a ket and
its conjugate imaginary bra are both specified by the same label,
must be extended to read-if the labels of a het involve complex

numbers or complex functions, the labels of the conjugate inmgimry
bra involve the conjugate complex numbers or functions. As in the

case of kets we can show that <q5(-§)ff(§) and <q5(§)f(-f)| are the same,
so that the vertical line can be omitted. We can consider (#5) as
the product of the linear operator q5(§) into the standard bra (, which

one from the point of View of the modern general theory.

is the conjugate imaginary of the standard lret  We may leave
the standard bra understood, so that a general bra is written as ME),
the conjugate complex of a wave function. The conjugate complex
of a wave function can be multiplied by any linear operator on the
right, but cannot be multiplied by a linear operator on the left. We
can construct triple products of the form <f(§)>. Such a triple product
is a number, equal to _f(§) summed or integrated over the whole
domain of eigenvalues for the §’s,

£11.. v

in the case when $1,", 5,, have discrete eigenvalues and 501.1,“, f.“ have
continuous eigenvalues.

The standard ket and bra are defined with respect to a representa-
tion. If me carried through the above work with a different repre-
sentation in which the complete set of commuting observables 1] are
diagonal, or if we merely changed the phase factors in the representa-
tion with the §’s diagonal, we should get a different standard ket and
bra. In a piece of work in which more than one standard ket or bra
appears one must, of course, distinguish them by giving them labels.

A further development of the notation which is of great importance
for dealing with complicated dynamical systems will now be discussed.
Suppose we have a dynamical system describable in terms of dynami-
cal variables which can all be divided into two sets, set A and set B
say, such that any member of set A commutes with any member of
set B. A general dynamical variable must be expressible as a function
of the A-variables and B-variables together. We may consider
another dynamical system in which the dynamical variables are the
A-variables only —let us call it the A-system. Similarly we may
consider a third dynamical system in which the dynamical variables
are the B-variables only—the B-system. The original system can
then be looked upon as a combination of the A-system and the
B-system in accordance with the mathematical scheme given below.

Let us take any ket (a) for the A-system and any ket |b> for the
B-system. We assume that they have a product |a)[b) for which
the commutative and distributive axioms of multiplication hold, 1,9,

la>lb> = |b>la>,
ic1lai>+czla2>llb> = 471la1>lb>+62iaz>lb>,
|a>{(31lb1>+c2|b2>} = clia>ibl>+c2ia>ib2>v

s2 REPRESENTATIONS §20

the c's being numbers. We can give a meaning to any A-variable
operating on the product la>|b> by assuming that it operates only
on the |a> factor and commutes with the |b> factor, and similarly
we can give a meaning to any B-variable operating on this product
by assuming that it operates only on the |b> factor and commutes
with the $\ket{a}$ factor. (This makes every A-variable commute with
every B-variable.) Thus any dynamical variable of the original
system can operate on the product $\ket{a}$|b>, so this product can be
looked upon as a ket for the original system, and may then be
written lab), the two labels a and b being sufficient to specify it.
In this way we get the fundamental equations

la>lb> = lb>la> = lab) (65)

The multiplication here is of quite a different kind from any that
occurs earlier in the theory. The ket vectors $\ket{a}$ and $\ket{b}$ are in two
different vector spaces and their product is in a third vector space,
which may be called the product of the two previous vector spaces.
The number of dimensions of the product space is equal to the
product of the number of dimensions of each of the factor spaces.
A general ket vector of the product space is not of the form (65), but
is a sum or integral of kets of this form.

Let us take a representation for the A-system in which a complete
set of commuting observables Q4 of the A-system are diagonal. We
shall then have the basic-bras (ﬁll for the A-system. Similarly,taking
a representation for the B-system with the observables 5B diagonal,
we shall have the basic bras (5 "31 for the B-system. The products

E <é;l<§;;-i = eras: <66)
will then provide the basic bras for a representation for the original
system, in which representation the {ifs and the §B’s will be diagonal.

The {ifs and §B’s will together form a complete set of commuting
observables for the original system. From (65) and (66) we get

<EQI<I><FBII>> = (5.2. éélabk (67)
showing that the representative of lab) equals the product of the
representatives of $\ket{a}$ and of $\ket{b}$ in their respective representations.

We can introduce the standard ket, >A say, for the A-system,
with respect to the representation with the fie, diagonal, and also
the standard ket >3 for the B-system, with respect to the repre-
sentation with the §B’s diagonal. Their product )A )5 is then the

§20 DEVELOPMENTS IN NOTATION 83

standard ket for the original system, wvith respect t0 the representa-
tion with the gs and §B’s diagonal. Any ket for the original system

may be expressed as (Mid awn >13“ (68)

It may be that in a certain calculation we wish to use a particular
representation for the B-system, say the above representation with
the §B’s diagonal, but do not wish to introduce any particular
representation for the A-system. It mould then be convenient to
use the standard ket >3 for the R-system and no standard ket for
the A-system. Under these circumstances we could write any ket

for the original system as I§B>>B) (69)

in which |§B> is a ket for the A-system and is also a function of the
g-"B’s, i.e. it is a ket for the A-system for each set of values for the

tO's —in fact (69) equals (68)if we take
|§B> = ‘Mir 53b4-

We 1ney leave the standard ket >3 in (69) understood, and then we
have the general ket for the original system appearing as EB), a ket
for the A-system and a Wave function in the variables 5B of the
B-system. An example of this notation will be used in $66.

The above Work can be immediately extended to a dynamical
system describable in terms of dynamical variables which can be
divided into three or more sets A, B, (l... such that any member of
one set commutes with any member of another. Equation (6.5) gets

the factors on the left being kets for the component systems and
the ket on the right being a Bet for the original system. Equations
(66), (67), and (68) get generalized to many factors in a similar may.
