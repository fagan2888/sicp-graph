#39. Energy-levels of the hydrogen atom

The above analysis may be applied to the problem of the hydrogen
atom with. neglect of relativistic mechanics and the spin of the

electron. The potential energy V is nowi‘ —e2/r, so that equation
(69) becomes

(73)

dr2_ T2 n2 7 M“ n2 X“

 

{d2 n(n+1) Zmezl 2mH'

A thorough investigation of this equation has been given by Schro-
dingeini We shall here obtain its eigenvalues H’ by an elementary
argument.

It is convenient to put

X, = _f(?')8“'fa, (74)
introducing the new function f(r), where a is one or other of the
square roots a z i\/(__ﬁ2/2mH,)_ (75)
Equation (73) now becomes

{$12 %.—”(n,.;H) $2182 ﬁrs) = 0. (v6)
We look for a solution of this equation in the form of a power series
f0‘) = Z 0J8» (77)

in which consecutive values for s differ by unity although these
values themselves need not be integers. On substituting ( 77) in (76)

we obtain
2 c8{s(s-- 1)r*’""2-—(2s/a)r8-1-n(n+ 1)rs-2+(2me2/%2)r“"1} = 0,

which gives, on equating to zero the coefficient of r8"? the following
relation between successive coefficients c8,

o3[s(s-- 1)--n(n+ 1)] = cs__1[2(s--- 1)/a-- Zmeﬂﬁz]. (78)

We saw in the preceding section that only those eigenfunctions x
are allowed that tend to zero with r and hence, from (74), f(r) must
tend to Zero with r. The series (77) must therefore terminate on the
side of small s and the minimum value of s must be greater than zero.
Now the only possible minimum values of s are those that make the
coefficient of as in (78) vanish, i.e. n+I and —n, and the second
of these is negative or zero. Thus the minimum value of s must be
n+ 1. Since n is always an integer, the values of s will all be integers.

tinguished from the e denoting the base of exponentials.

The series (77) will in general extend to inﬁnity on the side of large s.
For large values of s the ratio of successive terms is

cs __ 2i‘

according t0 (78). Thus the series (77) will always converge, as the
ratios of the higher terms to one another are the same as for the

series
1 (Zry (79)

2 a a =

which converges to cw“.

We must now examine how our solution X0 behaves for large
values of r. We must distinguish between the two cases of H' positive
and H’ negative. For H' negative, a given by (75) will be real. Sup-
pose we take the positive value for a. Then as r -+oo the sum of the
series (7 7) will tend to inﬁnity according to the same law as the sum
of the series (79), i.e. the law e27“. Thus, from (74), X0 will tend to
inﬁnity according to the law e7“ and will not represent a physically
possible state. There is therefore in general no permissible solution
of (73) for negative values of H‘. An exception arises, however, when-
ever the series (77 ) terminates on the side of large s, in which case the
boundary conditions are all satisﬁed. The condition for this termina-
tion of the series is that the coefficient of 08d in (78) shall vanish for
some value of the suffix s— l not less than its minimum value n-i- 1,
which is the same as the condition that

for some integer s not less than n+1. With the help of (75) this

condition becomes me4

and is thus a condition for the energy-level H’. Since s may be any
positive integer, the formula (80) gives a discrete set of negative
energy-levels for the hydrogen atom. These are in agreement with
experiment. For each of them (except the. lowest one s = 1) there
are several independent states, as there are various possible values
for n, namely any positive or zero integer less than s. This multi-
plicity of states belonging to an energy-levelis in addition to that
mentioned in the preceding section arising from the various possible

§39 ENERGY-LEVELS OF THE HYDROGEN ATOM 159

values for a component of angular momentum, which latter multi-
plicity occurs with any central ﬁeld of force. The n multiplicity occurs
only with an inverse square law of force and even then is removed
when one takes relativistic mechanics into account, as will be found
in Chapter XI. The solution X0 of (73) when H’ satisﬁes (80) tends to
zero exponentially as 1" -—>~ c0 and thus represents a closed state (corre-
sponding to an elliptic orbit in Bohr-ﬁe theory).

For any positive values of H’, a given by (75)Will be pure imaginary.
The series (77), which is like the series (7 9)for large r, will now have a
sum that remains ﬁnite as 1* -+ o0. Thus X0 given by (74)will now remain
ﬁnite as r ->~ oo and will therefore be a permissible solution of (7 3),
givinga wave function 5b that tends to zero according to the law ?""1 as
-r -+ oo. Hence in addition to the discrete set of negative energy-levels
(80), all positive energy-levels are allowed. The states of positive

m

energy are not closed, since for them the integral to inﬁnity I [Xolzdr
does not converge. (These states correspond to the hyperbolic orbits

of Bohfs theory.)
