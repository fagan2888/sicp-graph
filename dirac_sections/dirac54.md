#54. Symmetrical and antisymmetrical states

IF a system in atomic physics contains a number of particles of the
same kind, e.g. a number of electrons, the particles are absolutely
indistinguishable one from another. No observable change is made
when two of them are interchanged. This circumstance gives rise to
some curious phenomena in quantum mechanics having no analogue
in the classical theory, which arise from the fact that in quantum
mechanics a transition may occur resulting in merely the interchange
of two similar particles, which transition then could not be detected
by any observational means. A satisfactory theory ought, of course,
to count two observationally indistinguishable states as the same
state and to deny that any transition does occur when two similar
particles exchange places. We shall ﬁnd that it is possible to reformu-
late the theory so that this is so.

Suppose we have a system containing n similar particles. We lnay
take as our dynamical variables a set of variables £1 describing the
ﬁrst particle, the corresponding set E2 describing the second particle,
and so on up to the set 5,, describing the nth particle. We shall then
have the §,.’s commuting with the ﬁgs for r qé s. (We may require
certain extra variables, describing what the system consists of in
addition to the n similar particles, but it is not necessary to mention
these explicitly in the present chapter.) The Hamiltonian describing
the motion of the system will now be expressible as a function of the
§1,§2,...,§,,. The fact that the particles are similar requires that the
Hamiltonian shall be a symmetrical function cf the §1,§2,...,§,,, i.e. it
shall remain unchanged when the sets of variables 5,. are interchanged
or permuted in any way. This condition must hold, no matter what
perturbations are applied to the system. In fact, any quantity of
physical signiﬁcance must be a symmetrical function of the §’s.

Let 1a,), 151),... be kets for the first particle considered as a dynami-
cal system by itself. There will be correspondingkets 1a,), 152),... for
the second particle by itself, and so on. We can get a ket for the
assembly by taking the product of kets for each particle by itself,
for example

I¢11>lb2>l@a>---I9n> = J@1b2<=a~--9n> (1)

208 SYSTEMS CONTAINING SEVERAL SINHLAR PARTICLES § 54

say, according t0 the notation 0f (65) 0f $2 0. The ket (1) corresponds
t0 a special kind of state for the assembly, which may be described
by saying that each particle is in its own state, corresponding to its
own factor on the left-hand side of (1). The general ket for the
assembly is of the form of a sum or integral of kets like (l), and
corresponds to a state for the assembly for which one cannot say that
each particle is in its own state, but only that each particle is partly
in several states, in a way which is correlated with the other particles
being partly in several states. If the kets |a1>, 151),... are a set of
basic kets for the first particle by itself, the kets lag), |b2>,... will be
a set of basic kets for the second particle by itself, and so on, and the
kets (1)will be a set of basic kets for the assembly. We call the repre-
sentation provided by such basic kets for the assembly a symmetrical
representation, as it treats all the particles on the same footing.
In (1)we may interchange the kets for the first two particles and
get another ket for the assembly, namely
]b1>|a2>]c3>-"|gn> = lb1a263---9n>-
More generally, we may interchange the role of the first two particles
in any ket for the assembly and get another ket for the assembly.
The process of interchanging the first two particles is an operator
which can be applied to kets for the assembly, and is evidently a
linear operator, of the type dealt ‘with in § 7. Similarly, the process
of interchanging any pair of particles is a linear operator, and by
repeated applications of such interchanges we get any permutation
of the particles appearing as a Linear operator which can be applied
to kets for the assembly. A permutation is called an even permutation
or an odd permutation according to whether. it can be built up from
an even or an odd number of interchanges.
A ket for the assembly 1X) is called symmetrical if it is unchanged
by any permutation, i.e. if
PIX> = IX> (9)
for any permutation P. It is called antisymmetrical if it is unchanged
by any even permutation and has its sign changed by any odd

permutation, Le. if PIX) = ipo, (3)

the + or — sign being taken according to whether P is even or odd.
The state corresponding to a symmetrical ket is called a symmetrical
state, and the state corresponding to an antisymmetrical ket is called
an antisymmetrical state. In a symmetrical representation, the repre»

§54 SYMMETRICAL AND ANTISYMMETRICAL STATES 209

sentative of a symmetrical ket is a symmetrical function of the
variables referring t0 the various particles and the representative of
an antisyrnmetrical ket is an antisyrnmetrical function.

In the Schrodinger picture, the ket corresponding to a state of the
assembly will vary with time according to Schrodinger's equation of
motion. If it is initially symmetrical it must always remain sym-
metrical, since, owing to the Hamiltonian being symmetrical, there
is nothing to disturb the symmetry. Similarly if the ket is initially
antisymmetrical it must always remain antisymmetrical. Thus a
state which is initially symmetrical always remains symmetrical and
a state which is initially antisymmetrical always remains antisym-
metrical. In consequence, it may be that for a particular kind of
particle only symmetrical states occur in nature, or only anti-
symmetrical states occur in nature. If either of these possibilities
held, it would lead to certain special phenomena for the particles in
question.

Let us suppose first that only antisymmetrical states occur in
nature. The ket (1) is not antisymmetrical and so does not corre-
spond to a state occurring in nature. From (1) we can in general form
an antisymmetrical ket by applying all possible permutations to it
and adding the results, with the coefficient — 1 inserted before those
terms arising from an odd permutation, so as to get

the + or -- sign being taken according to whether P is even or odd.
The ket (4) may be written as a determinant

and its representative in a symmetrical representation is a determi-
nant. The ket (4) or (5) is not the general antisymmetrical ket, but
is a specially simple one. It corresponds to a state for the assembly
for which one can say that certain particle-states, namely the states
a,b,c,...,g, are occupied, but one cannot say which particle is in
which state, each particle being equally likely to be in any state. If

210 SYSTEMS CONTAINING SEVERAL SIMILAR PARTICLES $54

two of the particle-states a,b,c,...,g are the same, the ket (4) or (5)
vanishes and does not correspond to any state for the assembly.
Thus two particles cannot occupy the same state. More generally, the
occupied states must be all independent, otherwise (4) or (5) vanishes.
This is an important characteristic of particles for which only anti-
symmetrical states occur in nature. It leads to a special statistics,
which was first studied by Fermi, so we shall call particles for which
only antisymmetrical states occur in nature fermions.

Let us suppose now that only symmetrical states occur in nature.
The ket (l)is not symmetrical, except in the special case when all the
particle-states a,b,c,...,g are the same, but we can always obtain a
symmetrical ket from it by applying all possible permutations to it
and adding the results, so as to get

g Pl@15z@3---9n>- (6)

The ket (6) is not the general symmetrical ket, but is a specially
simple one. It corresponds to a state for the assembly for which one
can say that certain particle-states are occupied, namely the states
a,b, c,..., g, without being able to say which particle is in which state.
It is now possible for two or more of the states a,b,c,...,g to be the
same, so that two or more particles can be in the same state. In spite
of this, the statistics of the particles is not the same as the usual
statistics of the classical theory. The new statistics was first studied
by Bose, so we shall call particles for which only symmetrical states
occur in nature bosons.

We can see the difference of Bose statistics from the usual statistics
by considering a special case —that of only two particles and only two
independent states a and b for a particle. According to classical
mechanics, if the assembly of two particles is in thermodynamic
equilibrium at a high temperature, each particle will be equally likely
to be in either state. There is thus a probability 3% of both particles
being in state a, a probability i}; of both particles being in state b,
and a probability i; of one particle being in each state. In the quan-
tum theory there are three independent symmetrical states for the
pair of particles, corresponding to the symmetrical kets la,) 1a,),
jblﬂbg), and la,) lb2>+ la,) 151), and describable as both particles in
state a, both particles in state b, and one particle in each state
respectively. For thermodynamic equilibrium at a high temperature
these three states are equally probable, as was shown in § 33, so that

§54 SYMMETRICAL AND ANTISYMMETRICAL STATES 211

there is a probability l; of both particles being in state a, a probability
é of both particles being in state b, and a probability % of one particle
being in each state. Thus with Bose statistics the probability 0f two
particles being in the same state is greater than with classical statistics.
Bose statistics differ from classical statistics in the opposite direction
to Fermi statistics, for which the probability of two particles being
in the same state is zero.

In building up a theory of atoms on the lines mentioned at the
beginning of § 38, to get agreement with experiment one must assume
that two electrons are never in the same state. This rule is known as
Pauli 's exclusion principle. It shows us that electrons are fermions.
Planck's lawv of radiation shows us that photons are bosons, as only the
Bose statistics for photons will lead to Planck's law. Similarly, for
each of the other kinds of particle known in physics, there is experi-
mental evidence to show either that they are fermions, or that they
are bosons. Protons, neutrons, positrons are fermions, a-particles are
bosons. It appears that all particles occurring in nature are either
fermions or bosons, and thus only antisymmetrical or symmetrical
states for an assembly of similar particles are met with in practice.
Other more complicated kinds of symmetry are possible mathemati-
cally, but do not apply to any known particles. With a theory which
allows only antisymmetrical or only symmetrical states for a particu-
lar kind of particle, one cannot make a distinction between two states
which differ only through a permutation of the particles, so that the
transitions mentioned at the beginning of this section disappear.
