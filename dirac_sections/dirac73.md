#73. Theory of the positron

It has been mentioned in § 67 that the wave equation for the elec-
tron admits of twice as many solutions as it ought to, half of them
referring to states with negative values for the kinetic energy cpg-i-eAo.
This difficulty was introduced as soon as we passed from equation (5)
to equation (6) and is inherent in any relativistic theory. It occurs
also in classical relativistic theory, but is not then serious since, owing
to the continuity in the variation of all classical dynamical variables,
if the kinetic energy cpo-keAo is initially positive (when it must be
greater than or equal to mc2), it cannot subsequently be negative
(when it would have to be less than or equal to —mc2). In the
quantum theory, however, discontinuous transitions may take place,
so that if the electron is initially in a state of positive kinetic energy
it may make a transition to a state of negative kinetic energy. It is
therefore no longer permissible simply to ignore the negative-energy
states, as one can do in the classical theory.

Let us examine the negative-energy solutions of the equation

a little more closely. For this purpose it is convenient to use a repre-
sentation of the a's in which all the elements of the matrices repre-
senting 4x1, a2, and (x3 are real and all those of the matrix representing

a,, are pure imaginary or zero. Such a.representation may be obtained,
for instance, from that of § 67 by interchanging the expressions for a,
and a, in (If). If equation (56)is expressed as a matrix equation in
this representation and we put -1I for i all through it, we get, remem-
bering the i in (4),

l(""Po+ZAQ)_“O‘1(-*P1+SA1)"

i/a2(--]92+gA2)——oc3(~—P3—-|—§A3)+o¢mm6}$ I 0. (57)

Thus each solution 1b of the wave equation (56) has for its conjugate
complex if} a solution ofthe wave equation (57). Further, ifthe solution
1,6 of (56) belongs to a negative value for Cpo-l-QAO, the corresponding
solution i of (57) will belong to a positive value for cpO-ezlo. But the
operator in (57)is just what one would get if one substituted --e for e
in the operator in (56). It follows that each negative-energy solution
of (56)is the conjugate complex of a positive-energy solution of the
wave equation obtained from (56)by substitution of -—e for e, which
solution represents an electron of charge +e (instead of —e, as we
had up to the present) moving through the given electromagnetic ﬁeld.
Thus the unwanted solutions of (56) are connected with the motion
of an electron with a charge +e. (Itis not possible, of course, with
an arbitrary electromagnetic ﬁeld, to separate the solutions of (56)
definitely into those referringto positive andthose referring to negative
values for opO-l-eatélo, as such a separation would imply that transitions
from one kind to the other do not occur. The preceding discussion is
therefore only a rough one, applying to the case when such a separation
is approximately possible.)

In this way we are led to infer that the negative-energy solutions
of (56) refer to the motion of a new kind of particle having the mass
of an electron and the opposite charge. Such particles have been
observed experimentally and are called positrons. We cannot, how-
ever, simply assert that the negative-energy solutions represent posi-
trons, as this would make the dynamical relations all wrong. For
instance, it is certainly not true that a positron has a negative kinetic
energy. We must therefore establish the theory of the positrons on
a somewhat different footing. We assume that nearly all the negative-
energy states are occupied, with one electron in each state in accordance
with the exclusion principle of Pauli. An unoccupied negative-energy

state will now appear as something with a positive energy, since to
make it disappear, i.e. t0 ﬁll it up, we should have t0 add t0 it an
electron with negative energy. We assume that these unoccupied
negative-energy states are the positrons.

These assumptions require there to be a distribution of electrons
of inﬁnite density everywhere in the world. A perfect vacuum is a
region where all the states of positive energy are unoccupied and all
those of negative energy are occupied. In a perfect vacuum Maxwell's

equation div é. = 0

must, of course, be valid. This means that the infinite distribution
of negative-energy electrons does not contribute to the electric ﬁeld.
Only departures from the distribution in a vacuum will contribute
to the electric density j‘) in Maxwell's equation

divé‘ = 4173",. (58)
Thus there will be a contribution —e for each occupied state of posi-
tive energy and a contribution +e for each unoccupied state of
negative energy.

The exclusion principle will operate to prevent a positive-energy
electron ordinarily from making transitions to states of negative
energy. It will still be possible, however, for such an electron to
drop into an unoccupied state of negative energy. In this case we
should have an electron and positron disappearing simultaneously,
their energy being emitted in the form of radiation. The converse
process would consist in the creation of an electron and a positron
from electromagnetic radiation.

From the symmetry between occupied and unoccupied fermion
states discussed at the end of § 66, the present theory is essentially
symmetrical between the electrons and the positrons. We should
have an equivalent theory if we supposed the positrons to be the
basic particles, described by wave equations of the form (11) with --e
for e, and then supposed that nearly all the states of negative energy
for the positrons are ﬁlled up, a hole in the distribution of negative~
energy positrons being then interpreted as an ordinary electron. The
theory could be developed consistently with the hypothesis that all
the laws of physics are symmetrical between positive and negative
electric charge.
