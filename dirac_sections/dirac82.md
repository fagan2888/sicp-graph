#82. Applications

There are two important applications of the foregoing theory in
which effects are calculated that cannot be obtained from a more
primitive theory. These applications are concerned with a single
electron in a static electric or magnetic field. As a consequence of the
interaction of the electron with electromagnetic waves, the energy
levels are shifted somewhat from their values given by the elementary
theory. The important cases are:

(i) An electron in the Coulomb field of a proton. The theory here
leads to a shift in the energy levels of the hydrogen atom. It is
named the Lamb shift, after its discoverer.

(ii) An electron in a uniform magnetic field. The extra energy is

here interpreted as arising from an eXtra magnetic moment of
the (xlectron, ealletl the anemalraus magnetic Inomcnt.

To take a, static lielcl into account one merely has t0 introduce
potentials to describe it and add them 0n to the Iiotrvntiatls in the
Hamiltonian. The potentials of the static ﬁeld ark functions of
X,, x2, x3 only, and are numbers for each X,, x2, x3, not dynamical
variables, so their introduction does not increase the number of degrees
of freedom.

The calculations of the Lamb shift and anomalous magnetic moment
are rather complicated. They are given in detail, Working from the
Hamiltonian H, in the author's book lectures 0n Quantum Field
Theory (AcademicPress, 1966). The results are in good agreement With
experiment and provide a conﬁrmation of the theory.

These calculations Were made in terms of the Heisenberg picture
throughout. One may tackle quantum electrodynamics on the
Schrodinger picture, looking for a solution of the Schrodinger equation
by taking the no-particle ket, or a ket corresponding to just a few
particles present, as the initial ket of a perturbation procedure and
applying the standard perturbation technique. One finds that the
later terms are large and depend strongly on the cut-off, or are
infinite if there is no cut-off. The perturbation procedure is not
logically valid under these conditions.

Nevertheless people have developed this method a long Way and
have devised Working rules for discarding infinities (in a theory
Without cut-off) in a systematic manner, so that finite residual effects
remain. The procedure is described in many books, e.g. Heitler's
Quantum. Theory 0f Radiation (Clarendon Press, 1954). The original
calculations of the Lamb shift and anomalous magnetic moment Were
carried out on these lines, long before the corresponding calculations
in the Heisenberg picture. The results are the same by both methods.

I do not see hoW these calculations based on the Schrodinger
picture, supplemented by some Working rules, ‘can be presented as a
logical development of the standard principles of quantum mechanics.
The Schrodinger picture is unsuited for dealing With quantum electro-
dynamics, because the vacuum ﬂuctuations play such a dominant role
in it. These ﬂuctuations present great mathematical difficulties, and
also they are not of physical importance. They get bypassed when one
uses the Heisenberg picture, and one is then able to concentrate on
quantities that are of physical importance.
