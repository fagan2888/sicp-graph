#69. The motion of a free electron

It is-of interest to consider the motion of a free electron in the
Heisenberg picture according to the above theory and to study the
Heisenberg equations of motion. These equations of motion can be
integrated exactly, as Was first done by Schrodingerxjj For brevity
We shall omit the suffix z‘ Which the notation of § 28 requires to be
inserted in dynamical variables that vary With time in the Heisen-

berg picture.
As Hamiltonian We must take the expression Which We get as equal

to cpo When We put the operator on 1/1 in (1 0)equal to zero, i.e.

H = cP1(°'= P)+P3mc2 = CW: P)+P3mC2- 
We see at once that the momentum commutes with H and is thus a
constant of the motion. Further, the sat-component of the velocity is

3.71 = [$1, H] = 6%- 
This result is rather surprising, as it means an altogether different

relation between velocity and momentum from what one has ill
classical mechanics. It is connected, however, with the expression
gﬁldocl all for a component of theprobability current. The .231 given by (24)
has as eigenvalues 31:0, corresponding to the eigenvalues i1 of a1.
As :82 and 253 are similar, we can conclude that a measurement of a com-
ponent 0f the velocity 0f a free electron is certain t0 leaa’ to the result 3136-
This conclusion is easily seen to hold also when there is a ﬁeld present.

Since electrons are observed in practice to have velocities con-
siderably less than that of light, it would seem that we have here a
contradiction with experiment. The contradiction is not real, though,
since the theoretical velocity in the above conclusion is the velocity
at one instant of time while observed velocities are always average
velocities through appreciable time intervals. We shall ﬁnd upon
further examination of the equations of motion that the velocity is
not at all constant, but oscillates rapidly about a mean value which
agrees with the observed value.

It may easily be veriﬁed that a measurement of a component of the
velocity must lead to the result is in a relativistic theory, simply
from an elementary application of the principle of uncertainty of
§ 24. To measure the velocity we must measure the position at two
slightly different times and then divide the change of position by the
time interval. (It will not do to measure the momentum and apply
a formula, as the ordinary connexion between velocity and momen-
tum is not validz) In order that our measured velocity may approxi-
mate to the instantaneous velocity, the time interval between the
two measurements of position must be very short and hence these
measurements must be very accurate. The great accuracy with
which the position of the electron is known during the time-interval
must give rise, according to the principle of uncertainty, to an almost
complete indeterminacy in its momentum. This means that almost
all values of the momentum are equally probable, so that the momen-
tum is almost certain to be infinite. An inﬁnite value for a component
of momentum corresponds to the value 31:0 for the corresponding
component of velocity.

Let us now examine how the velocity of the electron varies with

time. We have iﬁdl = a1 H__Ha1_

Now since a, anticommutes with all the terms in H except coal p1,

Since H and p1 are constants, it follows from the first of equsttions
05mm aha, = 2a1H. (26)
This differential equation in a, can be integrated immediately, the
result be1ng C21 z dgea-zzzrz/n, (27)

where a; is a constant, equal to the value of d1 when t= 0. The
factor efim/ﬁ must be put to the right of the factor d? in (2 7) on
account of the H occurring to the right of the d, in (26). The seconcl
of equations (25)leads in the same way to the result

d1 z gems/nag.

We can now easily complete the integration of the equation of motion
for x1. From (2 7)and the first of equations (25)

0,1 z éiﬁdllle-2ifff/ﬁH-1+CP1H—1; (28)
and hence the time-integral of equation (24)is

a, being a constant.
From (28)we see that the x, component of velocity, cal, consists

of two parts, a constant part 0239111“, connected with the momentum
by the classical relativistic formula, and an oscillatory part

whose frequency is high, being ZH/k, which is at least QmcB/ia. Only
the constant part would be observed in a practical measurement of
velocity, such a measurement giving the average velocity through a
time-interval much larger than h/2mc2. The oscillatory part secures

that the instantaneous value of x, shall have the eigenvalues is. The
oscillatory part of x1 is small, being, according to (29),
