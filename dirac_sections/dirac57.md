#57. Determination of the energy-levels

Let us apply the perturbation method of § 43 and make a ﬁrst-order
calculation of the energy-levels in the case when the Hamiltonian
does not involve the time explicitly. We suppose that for our unper-
turbed stationary states of the assembly each of the similar particles
has its own individual state. With n particles, we shall have n of

assume for the present to be all orthogonal. The ket for the assembly

like (1) with 0:1, 09,... instead of a, b,... . If we apply any permutation
P to it we get another ket

PIX> = le§>I¢§>---l@?> (17)
say, w", s,..., z being some permutation of the numbers l, 2,..., n,
corresponding to another stationary state of the assembly with the
same energy. There are thus altogether n! unperturbed states with
this energy, if we assume there are no other causes of degeneracy.
According to the method of § 43 when the unperturbed system is
degenerate, we must consider those elements of the matrix represent-
ing the perturbing energy V that refer to two states with the same
energy, i.e. those of the type (X {Pa VQIX). These will form a matrix
with n! rows and columns, whose eigenvalues are the first-order
corrections in the energy-levels.

We must now introduce another kind of permutation operator
which can be applied to kets of the form (l7), namely a permutation
which acts on the indices of the a's. We denote such a permutation
operator by Pa. The essential difference between the P's and the
P°"s may be seen in the following way. Let us consider a permutation
in the general sense, say that consisting of the interchange of 2 and 3.
This may be interpreted either as the interchange of the objects 2 and
3 or as the interchange of the objects in the places 2 and 3, these two
operations producing in general quite different results. The first of
these interpretations is the one that gives the operators P, the objects
concerned being. the similar particles. A permutation P can be
applied to an arbitrary ket for the assembly. A permutation with the
second interpretation has a meaning, however, only when applied
to a ket of the form (17), for which each of the particles is in a 'place'
specified by an a, or to a sum of kets of the form (l7). A permutation
P may be considered as an ordinary dynamical variable. A permuta-
tion Pa may be considered as a dynamical variable in a restricted
sense, valid when one is dealing only with states obtainable by super-
position of the various states (l7). This is the case for our present
perturbation problem.

We can form algebraic functions of the P“ which will be other
operators applicable to kets of the form (l7). In particular we can

218 SYSTEMS CONTAINING SEVERAL SIMILAR PARTICLES § 57

form X(P§’,‘), the average of all P“’s in a certain class c. This must
equal X(R,), the average of the permutation operators P in the same
class, since the total set of all permutations in a given class must
evidently be the same whether the permutations are applied to the
particles or to the places the particles are in. Any P commutes with

any PO, i.e. Pap? = Pgpa. (18)

By labelling the a's by the same numbers 1, 2, 3,..., n which label
the particles, we set up a one-one correspondence between the a's and
the particles, so that given any permutation Pa applying to the par-
ticles, we can give a meaning to the same permutation Pg applying
to the a's. This meaning is such that, for the ket |X> given by (16),

PgPa|X> = |X>. (19)

Since the various kets la*), Ia2),... are orthogonal, [X > and PIX) are
orthogonal unless P = 1. It follows that, for any coefficients 0P,

2 cP<XiPaPaiX> L- 01», <20)
P

provided |X> is normalized, the summation being over all the n!
permutations P or Pa, with Pa fixed. Now deﬁne VP by,

VP = <X|VP[X>. (21)
We then have, for any two permutations Pm and Pg,
(XIPQ, VPy|X> = (XIVREPMX) = V1311)”
= g VP <X|P°‘PxPy|X>

with the help of (20). From (18) this gives
<X|Px VPy|X> = g VP (X[Pa, P°‘P,,|X>. (22)

We may write this result as
V2‘: ZVPP", (23)
P

where the sign m means an equation in a restricted sense, the
operators on the two sides being equal so long as they are used only
with kets of the form PIX) and their conjugate imaginary bras.
The formula (23) shows that the perturbing energy V is equal, in
the restricted sense, to a linear function of the permutation operators
P“ with coefficients VP given by (21). The restricted sense is adequate
for the calculation of the first-order correction in the energy-levels,
as this calculation involves only those matrix elements of V given by

§I57 DETERMINATION OF THE ENERGY-LEVELS 219

(22). The formula (23)is a very convenient one because the expression
on its right-hand side is easily handled.

As an example of an application of (23) we shall determine the
average energy of all those states, arising from the unperturbed state
(16), that belong to one exclusive set. This requires us to calculate
the average eigenvalue of V for those states (17) for Which the X’s
have speciﬁed numerical values X’. Now the average eigenvalue of
Pa‘ for any of these states equals that of P°‘P§(P°‘)*1 for arbitrary
Pa and thus equals that of n!“ gPﬁPﬁPakl, which is X'(Pff) or
x'(P

a). Hence the average eigenvalue of V is g VP X’(P). A similar

method could be used for calculating the average eigenvalue of any
function of V, it being necessary only to replace each Pa by X’(P) to
perform the averaging.

The number of energy-levels in an exclusive set X = X’ that arise
from a given state of the unperturbed system is equal to the number
of eigenvalues of the right-hand side of (23)that are consistent with
the equations X = X’. This number is the number n(X’) introduced
at the end of the preceding section, and is thus just the degree of
degeneracy of the states in this set.

We have assumed that the individual kets 1&1), laZ),  which deter-
mine the unperturbed state according to (l6) are all orthogonal. The
theory can easily be extended to the case when some of these kets are
equal, any two that are not equal being still restricted to be orthogonal.
We now have some permutations Pa such that PHX) = 1X),
namely those permutations which involve only interchanges of
equal a's. Equation (20) will now hold if the summation is extended
only over those P’s which make-~P°‘|X> different. With this change
in the meaning of g, all the previous equations still hold, including

the result (23). For the present IX) there will be restrictions on the
possible numerical values of the X’s, eg. they cannot have those
values corresponding to IX) being antisymmetrical.
