#16. Properties of the basic vectors

Using the notation of the 6 function, we can proceed with the theory
of representations. Let us suppose ﬁrst that we have a single observ-
able 5 forming by itself a complete commuting set, the condition for
this being that there is only one eigenstate of 5 belonging to any
eigenvalue f’, and let us set up an orthogonal representation in which
the basic vectors are eigenvectors of E and are written (SI, 1E’).

In the case when the eigenvalues of i are discrete, we can normalize
the basic vectors, and we then have

<€’|§”> = 0 (€’ #15’),

<€'|€'> = 1-
These equations can be combined into the single equation
<§'|§"> = 5.5%», (15)

where the symbol 6 with two suﬁxes, which we shall often use in the
future, has the meaning

8,8 = O when r 7i s } (17)
= 1 when 1" = s.

In the case when the eigenvalues of 4f are continuous we cannot
normalize the basic vectors. If we now consider the quantity Of’ If’)
with 5' ﬁxed and f’ varying, we see from the work connected with
expression (29) of § 10 that this quantity vanishes for i" # E’ and
that its integral over a range of 5” extending through the value 4f’
is finite, equal to c say. Thus

<s'|s"> = v5(€’—-£”)-
From (30) of § 10, c is a positive number. It may vary with E’, so
we should write it 0(8) or c’ for brevity, and thus we have
<s'|s"> = v mea"). <18)
Alternatively, we have
<s'|§"> = <="8<s'-§">. <19)
where o” is short for c(f”), the right-hand sides of (18) and (19) being
equal on account of (11).
Let us pass to another representation whose basic vectors are
eigenvectors of 5, the new basic vectors being numerical multiples of

the previous oneis. Calling the new basic vectors (f’* ], 15*), with the
additional label to distinguish them from the previous ones, we have

<s'*1 = kwaw. |s'*> = Fm

§15 PROPERTIES OF THE BASIC VECTORS 63
where h’ is short for lc(§') and is a number depending on E’. We get
<§r4<l€m|¢> i krg<érlén> ____ fcfFc-i’ 

with the help of (l8). This may be written
<€'*|§”*> = k’F@'5(€'—§")

from (l l). By choosing k’ so that its modulus is c"'i', which is possible
since c’ is positive, we arrange to have

<€'*l€”*> = 5(§'-€")- (20)
The lengths of the new basic vectors are now fixed so as to make the
representation as simple as possible. The way these lengths were
fixed is in some respects analogous to the normalizing of the basic
vectors in the case of discrete ‘f’, equation (20) being of the form of
(l6) with the 6 function 8(§’--§”) replacing the 6 symbol 5&- of

equation (l6). We shall continue to work with the new representation
and shall drop the f‘ labels in it to save writing. Thus (20) will now

‘w Writ“ <§’1§"> = ace-at» <21)

We can develop the theory on closely parallel lines for the discrete
and continuous cases. For the discrete case we have, using (16),

g l§'><§'IE"> =  |§'>3ga§' = If”),

the sum being taken over all eigenvalues. This equation holds for
any basic ket 1E") and hence, since the basic kets form a complete set,

g |€'><E'| = 1- (22)

This is a useful equation expressing an important property of the
basic vectors, namely, if l5’) is multiplied on the right by (Fl the
resulting linear operator, summed for all 5', equals the unit operator.
Equations (16)a.11d (22)give the fundamental properties of the basic
vectors for the discrete case.
Similarly, for the continuous case we have, using (21),

f |§-">d6’ <».='|s"> == f :§’>de'8<s'-s"> = |s"> <23)

from (4) applied with a ket vector for f(a:), the range of integration
being the range of eigenvalues. This holds for any basic ket |f")

and hence
f 1:» are <6: = 1. <24)

e4 REPRESENTATIONS § 16

This is of the same form as (22) with an integral replacing the sum.
Equations (21) and (24) give the fundamental properties of the basic
vectors for the continuous case.

Equations (22) and (24) enable one to expand any bra or ket in
terms of the basic vectors. For example, we get for the ket |P> in the
discrete case, by multiplying (22) on the right by {P}, a

l?) =  |€'><5'|P>= (25)

which gives IP) expanded in terms of the ]§')’s and shows that the
coefficients in the expansion are (§'|P which are just the numbers
forming the representative of IP). Similarly, in the continuous case,

|P> = f 15> as <§'sP>. <26)

giving |P> as an integral over the I§’>’s, with the coefﬁcient in the
integrand again just the representative <5’ |P) of fP). The conjugate
imaginary equations to (25) and (26) would give the bra vector (P I
expanded in terms of the basic bras.

011:: present mathematical methods enable us in the continuous
case to expand any ket as an integral of eigenkets of E. If we do not
use the 6 function notation, the expansion 011a. general ket will consist
of an integral plus a sum, as in equation (25) of $ 1 0 , but the 6 function
enables us to replace the sum by an integral in which the integrand
consists of terms each containing a 5 function as a factor. For
example, the eigenket IE”) may be replaced by an integral of eigen-
kets, as is shown by the second of equations (23).

If (Q! is any bra and |P> any ket we get, by further applications

for discrete E’ and

<Q|P> z f <Qlé'> d? <s’|P> <28)

for continuous f’. These equations express the scalar product of (Q1
and IP) in terms of their representatives (Q|§’> and (FIP). Equa-
tion (27) is just the usual formula for the scalar product of two
vectors in terms of the coordinates of the vectors, and (28) is the
natural modification of this formula for the case of continuous f’,
with an integral instead of a sum.

The generalization of the foregoing work to the case when E has
both discrete and continuous eigenvalues is quite straightforward.

§16 PROPERTIES OF THE BASIC VECTORS 65

Using ‘f’ and E“ t0 denote discrete eigenvalues and 5’ and f" t0 denote
continuous eigenvalues, We have the set of equations

<s'|a~>=B,,=',-. <s=~|s'>=o. <s*|s"> =B<s'-s"> <29)

as the generalization of (16) or (21). These equations express that
the basic vectors are all orthogonal, that those belonging to discrete
eigenvalues are normalized and those belonging to continuous eigen-
values have their lengths ﬁxed by the same rule as led to (20). From
(29) v)? can derive, as the generalization of (22) or (24),

the range of integration being the range of continuous eigenvalues.
With the help of (30), We get immediately

|P> =  lE"><é’lP>+ f |s'> dz’ <s'|P> <31)
as the generalization of (25) or (26), and
<QIP> = g <cnsr><araP>+ f <QI€’> ds’ <s'|P> 432)

as the generalization of (27) or (28).

Let us noW pass to the general case When We have several commuting
observables E1, $2,“, i.“ forming a complete commuting set and set up
an orthogonal representation in Which the basic vectors are simul-
taneous eigenvectors of all of them, and are Written <§'1...§,f,|, Iﬂufi).
Let us suppose E1,§2,...,§,, (v ~<\_ u) have discrete eigenvalues and
§v+1,...,§u have continuous eigenvalues.

Consider the quantity (£1.45; E;,+1..§.I,]§1..§§, §f,+,_..§;>. From the
orthogonality theorem, it must vanish ‘unless each é; = f; for
s --= v+l,..,u. By extending the Work connected With expression
(29) of §l0 to simultaneous eigenvectors of several commuting
observables and extending also the axiom (30), We ﬁnd that the
(u-vyfold integral of this quantity with respect to each é; over
a, range extending through the value g; is a. ﬁnite positive number.
Calling this number c', the ’ denoting that it is a function of
ﬁr.’ 5;, §§,+1,.., 5.1,, We can express our results by the equation

(514;§L+1--§L|€i--§L€Z+1--€Z> = <1’5(§L+1-€Z+1)--3(EL—§Z), (33)

With one 6 factor on the right-hand side for each value of s from
v+l to u. We noW change the lengths of our basic vectors so as to

66 REPRESEXTATIONS §16

make c' unity, by a procedure similar t0 that which led t0 (20). By
a further use of the orthogonality theorem, we get ﬁnally

<E1---6l.l§§---€i'.> = 5§1§1--5§;§:3(§L+1~EZ+1)~-3(§Z.-EL'Z), (34)

with a two-suffix 8 synfbﬁ on the right-friend side for each 5 with
discrete eigenvalues and a 5 function for each § with continuous
eigenvalues. This is the generalization of (16) or (21) to the case when
there are several commuting observables in the complete set.

From (34) we can derive, as the generalization of (22) or (24)

,2, H I€1---é;>d§;+1--dé;<E1---§;.l = 1. <35)

the integral being a (u~—-v)-fo1d one over all the §"s with continuous
eigenvalues and the summation being over all the §”s with discrete
eigenvalues. Equations (34) and (35) give the fundamental properties
of the basic vectors in the present case. From (35) we can imme-
diately write down the generalization of (2 5)or (2 6)and of (27) or (28).

The case we have just considered can be further generalized by
allowing some of the Es to have both discrete and continuous eigen-
values. The modiﬁcations required in the equations are quite straight-
forward, but will not be given here as they are rather cumbersome to
write down in general form.

There are some problems in which it is convenient not to make the
c' of equation (33) equal unity, but to make it equal to some definite
function of the §”s instead. Calling this function of the §”s p’"1 we
then have, instead of (34)

<€1---€Ll€§---§Z1> == P"15§1§:--5§;§;5(€L+r~ Z+1)-~5(€Z.-—§ZZ), (36)
and instead of (35) we get

p’ is called the weight function of the representation, p’d§;,+1..d§._f,
being the ‘Weight’ attached to a small volume element of the space
of the variables §§,+1,.., 5;.

The representations we considered previously all had the weight
function unity. The introduction of a weight function not unity is
entirely a matter of convenience and does not add anything to the
mathematical power of the representation. The basic bras <.§;...§;,*|
of a representation with the weight function p‘ are connected with

non-unit weight function occurs when one has two 8s which are
the polar and azimuthal angles I9 and g6 giving a direction in three-
dimensionalspace and one takes p‘ = sin 9’. One then has the element
of solid angle sin t9’d6’dg!>' occurring in (37).
