#40. Selection rules

If a dynamical system is set up in a certain stationary state, it will
remain in that stationary state so long as it is not acted upon by
outside forces. Any atomic system in practice, however, frequently
gets acted upon by external electromagnetic ﬁelds, under whose
inﬂuence it is liable to cease to be in one stationary state and to make
a transition to another. The theory of such transitions will be de-
veloped in §§ 44 and 45. A result of this theory is that, to a high degree
of accuracy, transitions between two states cannot occur under the
inﬂuence of electromagnetic radiation if, in a Heisenberg representa-
tion with these two stationary states as two of the basic states, the
matrix element, referring to these two states, of the representative
of the total electric displacement D of the system vanishes. Now it
happens for many atomic systems that the great majority of the
matrix elements of D in a Heisenberg representation do ‘vanish, and
hence there are severe limitations on the possibilities for transitions.
The rules that express these limitations are called selection rules.

The idea of selection rules can be reﬁned by a more detailed
application of the theory of §§ 44 and 45, according to ‘which
the matrix elements of the different Cartesian components of the
vector D are associated with different states of polarization of the

160 ELEMENTARY APPLICATIONS §40

electromagnetic radiation. The nature of this association is just what
one would get if one considered the matrix elements, or rather their
real parts, as the amplitudes of harmonic oscillators which interact
with the ﬁeld of radiation according to classical electrodynamics.
There is a general method for obtaining all selection rules, as
follows. Let us call the constants of the motion which are diagonal in
the Heisenberg representation a's and let D be one of the Cartesian
components of D. We must obtain an algebraic equation connecting
D and the afs which does not involve any dynamical variables other
than D and the a's and which is linear in D. Such an equation will

f h f

where the fjs and gfs are functions of the hfs only. If this equation
is expressed in terms of representatives, it gives us

§f.(~')<a'|1>h">g.e"> === 0.
or <<>=’|Dl@”> §fr(<!’)9,(e") == 0,
which shows that <a'|1>|h"> = 0 11111655
Zfr(@¢')9'r(e”) =Y 0- (82)

This last equation, giving the connexion which must exist between
a’ and ca" in order that (o¢’|D|h¢") may not vanish, constitutes the
selection rule, so far as the component D of D is concerned.

Our work on the harmonic oscillator in § 34 provides an example
of a selection rule. Equation (8)is of the form (8l)with 1'9’ for D and
H playing the part of the ofs, and it shows that the matrix elements
(H' ]5§|H”> of 6;‘ all vanish except those for which H”--H’ = 15w. The
conjugate complex of this result is thatthe matrix elements (H' h; 1H”)
of 1) all vanish except those for which H — H' = -?iw. Since q is a
numerical multiple of vq-ﬁ, its matrix elements (H’|g|H”> all vanish
except those for which H"--—H’ = iﬁw. If the harmonic oscillator
carries an electric charge, its electric displacement D will be pro-
portional to q. The selection rule is then that only those transitions
can take place in which the energy H changes by a single quan-
tum 15w.

We shall now obtain the selection rules for m, and l: for an electron
moving in a central ﬁeld of force. The components.of electric dis~

§40 SELECTION RULES 161

placement are here proportional to the Cartesian coordinates x, y, z.
Taking ﬁrst mg, we have that m5 commutes with z, or that

mzzwzmz = 0.

This is an equation of the required type (81), giving us the selection

rule ,
mz-m; = 0

for the z-component of the displacement. Again, from equations
(23)we have [mzlmzaxn = [may] = um
or mﬁas-Qmzxmz-i-xmﬁ-lﬁx = 0,
which is also of the type (81) and gives us the selection rule
mff-2m:,m;+m;2—h2 = 0

or (m;-m;’—-ﬁ)(m;-—m;+ﬁ) = O

for the x-component of the displacement. The selection rule for the
y-component is the same. Thus our selection rules for m5 are that
in transitions associated with radiation with a polarization corresponding
to an electric dipole in the Z-direction, m; cannot change, while in transi-
tions associated with a polarization corresponding to an electric dipole
in the x-direction or y-direction, m; mast change by iii-

We can determine more accurately the state of polarization of the
radiation associated with a transition in which m; changes by iii, by
considering the condition for the non-vanishing of matrix elements
of x+iy and x-iy. We have

[mwx-l-iy] = y-ix = —i(a;+iy)
or m,,(=v+iy)~—(=v+iy)(mz+%) = 0,
which is again of the type (81). It gives
mgﬂmg-li = O
as the condition that (mgx-l-iylmg) shall not vanish. Similarly,
mgp-mg-f-li = 0
is the condition that <m;]:c—iylm§> shall not vanish. Hence
<m.;|%"'5?1ImL-?i> = 0
0r <mélﬂ=lmlr~ﬁ> = Kmélylmkii) = (@+ib)@i""
say, a, b, and w being real. The conjugate complex of this is
<mg~hlxlmg> = -i<m;—-hjy§m;> = (a-ibyriw‘.

Thus the vector %{(m;|D[m;--h>+<m;—-liID[mL>}, which determines

162 ELEMENTARY APPLICATIONS §4=0

the state of polarization of the radiation associated with transitions
for Which m; = mQ-izl, has the following three components

EKmL|xlﬂlkeﬁ>+<mlrrﬁlxlmfa>l l
= +{(a+ib)e"W'+ (a--£b)e*iw‘} = a cos wt--b sin wt,
ékmélylmé-eﬁwi-<m;—%|y|m;>} > (83)
L- %,_~i{—~(a-|-£b)e'*5°°‘-|-(aF-ébyriwi} = asinwt-l-b coswt,
%{<m;1z]mf,——ﬁ>-|—(m;--?i]z|m;)} = 0. ,1

From the form of these components We see that the associated radia-
tion moving in the z-direction will be circularly polarized, that
moving in any direction in the zy-plane will be linearly polarized in
this plane, and that moving in intermediate directions Will be
elliptically polarized. The direction of circular polarization for radia-
tion moving in the z-direction Will depend on Whether W is positive
or negative, and this Will depend on Which of the tWo states m; or
m; = mg-fi, has the greater energy.
We shall now determine the selection rule for k. We have

[kUc-Hi), z] = [mi zH-[wzgo z]
—ymz~—wzxy+xmy+nzyx
Zbnyaz-mxy-l-iﬁz)

Similarly, [kUc-l-iixaz] = Mymzumy 2:)
and [k(ic+?i),y] = 2(?TL$Z——1B’)7I/z).
Hence

[k(k+%), [7¢(k+%), Zll

= 4lmmx+myy-l-mzzlmz"4(mi+mi+mi)z+

From (22) mxx-l-myy-f-mzz = 0 (84)
and hence
Wk-Hi), [1@(7¢+%)= Zll = *9{k(1@+%)/@+Zk(k+"i)}=
Which gives
k2(ic-|-?i)2z--ZIcQIc-J-ﬁJzkUa-i-ﬁ)+zk2(k+?i)2—
--~2¥iz{k(lc+?el)z+zlc(k+fi)} .—.-_. 0. (85)

§40 SELECTION RULES 163

Similar equations hold for x and y. These equations are of the re-
quired type (81), and give us the selection rule

k’2(k’+¥i)2—2k’(k’-|-%)Ic”(k"+h)+k”2(lc”+ﬁ)2-
-2ﬁ2k’(k’+?i)-2ﬁ2k”(k”+h) = 0,
which reduces to
(k’+lc"+2ﬁ)(k’+k”)(k’—k"+fi)(lc’—-la"—-ﬁ) = 0.

A transition can take place between two states k’ and k” only if one
of these four factors vanishes.

Now the first of the factors, (Ic’-l-k”+2¥i), can never vanish, since
the eigenvalues of is are all positive or zero. The second, (id-l-lc”), can
vanish only if k’ = 0 and 7c" = 0. But transitions between two states
with these values for k cannot occur on account of other selection
rules, as may be seen from the following argument. If two states
(labelled respectively with a single prime and a double prime) are
such that 1c’ = 0 and k” = 0, then from (4])and the corresponding
results for mg and my, m; = m; = m; = 0 and  = m; = m; = O.
The selection rule for m, now shows that the matrix elements of
x and y referring to the two states must vanish, as the value of m,
does not change during the transition, and the similar selection rule
for ma, or my shows that the matrix element of z also vanishes. Thus
transitions between the two states cannot occur. Our selection rule

for 1c now reduces to
(Ic’-k”+r‘i)(k'—»k”-%) = 0,
showing that k must change by iii. This selection rule may be written
k’2--2k’k”+?a”2~—%2 = 0,

and since this is the condition that a matrix element (k’[z|k”> shall
not vanish, we get the equation

lczz-ﬂlczlc-I-zliﬁwiﬂz = O
O1‘ [ks [ks  i "Z; 

a result which could not easily be obtained in a more direct way.
As a final example we shall obtain the selection rule for the magni-
tude K of the total angular momentum M of a general atomic system.
Let x, y, z be the coordinates of one of the electrons. We must obtain
the condition that the (K', K ) matrix element of x, y, or z shall not
vanish. This is evidently the same as the condition that the (K’, K )
matrix element of A, A2, or A, shall not vanish, where A, A, and A,

164 ELEMENTARY APPLICATIONS §40

are any three independent linear functions of a3, y, and z with numeri-
cal coefﬁcients, or more generally with any coefficients that commute
with K and are thus represented by matrices which are diagonal with

respect to K. Let A0 : Mxx+Myy+mizza
A, = Myzwlﬂy-wlﬁx,
A, = MzxwMmzwiﬁy,
A, = MmywMyome-iﬁz.

We have

llIxhg-l-My Ay-l-Mzh, = Z (ﬂIxMyz—-Mxll4;y--@%M$x)

$115

xgﬂ-‘lfzﬂlzp-Myﬂfay-‘itﬁlllgﬁ r 0 (87)

from (29). Thus A, A, and A, are not linearly independent functions
of x, y, and z. Any two of them, however, together with A, are three
linearly independent functions of x, y, and z and may be taken as the
above A,, A,, A3, since the coefficients Mm, My, 1% all commute with K.
Our problem thus reduces to finding the condition that the (K ',K )
matrix elements of A,, A, A, and A, shall not vanish. The physical
meanings of these A's are that A, is proportional to the component of
the vector (x, y,z) in the direction of the vector M, and A, A, A, are
proportional to the Cartesian components of the component of (x, y, z)
perpendicular to M.

Since A, is a scalar it must commute xvith K. It follows that only
the diagonal elements <K’|)l,,|K'> of A, can differ from zero, so the
selection rule is that K cannot change so far as A0 is concerned. Apply-
ing (30)to the vector A, A,, A, we have

[llgjxx] z: Aw UM; T“ “Aw [EH21 A2] = 0'

These relations between M, and A, A,, A, are of exactly the same form
as the relations (23), (24)between m, and x,y,z, and also (8 7)is of
the same form as ( 8 4). The dynamical variables A, A,,, A, thus have the
same properties relative to the angular momenturn M as x, y, z have
relative to m. The deduction of the selection rule for k when the
electric displacement is proportional to (x, y, z) can therefore be taken
over and applied to the selection rule for K when the electric displace-
ment is proportional to (A,, A, A,). We find in this way that, so far as
A A, A, are concerned, the selection rule for K is that it must change
by iﬁ.

Collecting results, we have as the selection rule for K that it must
change by O or i5. We have considered the electric displacement

§40 SELECTION RULES 165

produced by only one of the electrons, but the same selection rule
must hold for each electron and thus also for the total electric dis-

placement.
