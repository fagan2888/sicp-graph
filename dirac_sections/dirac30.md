#30. The free particle

The most fundamental and elementary application of quantum
mechanics is to the system consisting merely of a free particle, or
particle not acted on by any forces. For dealing with it we use as
dynamical variables the three Cartesian coordinates x, y, z and their
conjugate momenta p,,, p,, p,. The Hamiltonian is equal to the
kinetic energy of the particle, namely

H = §goi+pi+pe <22)

according to Newtonian mechanics, m being the mass. This formula
is valid only if the velocity of the particle is small compared with c,
the velocity of light. For a rapidly moving particle, such as we often
have to deal with in atomic theory, (22) must be replaced by the
relativistic formula

H = @(m2<>*+21>.%+2v§,+2@§)*- (23)

For small values of p,,, p,, and p, (23) goes over into (22), except for
the constant term mcZ which corresponds to the rest-energy of the
particle in the theory of relativity and which has no inﬂuence on the
equations of motion. Formulas (22) and (23) can be taken over
directly into the quantum theory, the square root in (23) being now
understood as the positive square root defined at the end of $1 1.
The constant term mc2 by which (23)differs from (22)for small values
of p,,, p,, and p, can still have no physical effects, since the Hamil-
tonian in the quantum theory, as introduced in § 27, is undefined to
the extent of an arbitrary additive real constant.

We shall here work with the more accurate formula (23). We shall
first solve the Heisenberg equations of motion. From the quantum
conditions (9) of § 2l, pg commutes with p, and p,,, and hence, from
Theorem l of § 19 extended to a set of commuting observables, p,,
commutes with any function of pa, p,, and p, and therefore with H.
It follows that p, is a constant of the motion. Similarly p, and p, are
constants of the motion. These results are the same as in the classical

§30 THE FREE PARTICLE 119

theory. Again, the equation of motion for a coordinate, x, say, is,
according to (11),
192, x 115%‘ = x,c(m2c2-}—Pi-i-P§+P§)i""6(°‘"2C2+29§+P§+P§)i$:-

The right-hand side here can he evaluated by means of formula

The magnitude of the velocity is
v = <a+yt+zr>i = <52(Pg+29§+19g)i/H- <26)

Equations (25) and (2 6) are just the same as in the classical theory.
Let us consider a state that is an eigenstate of the momenta,
belonging to the eigenvalues p2,, 10;, pg. This state must be an eigen-
state of the Hamiltonian, belonging to the eigenvalue
H’ r- <>(m2¢2+21i£+2>{,2+2>;2)% (27)
and must therefore be a stationary state. The possible values for H’
are all numbers from mo? to 0o, as in the classical theory. The Wave
function Mxyz) representing this state at any time in Schr6dinger’s
representation must satisfy

P§=¢($?/Z)> = 2% sﬂwyz) = H??? albgfcyzb,

 

With similar equations for p, and p4,. These equations show that
Mxyz) is of the form

 2 aei(p’,w+z1;zr+p;z)!?i,
Where a is independent of x, y, and z. From (18)We see now that the
time-dependent Wave function tﬂxyzt) is of the form

(“my”) z a0ei(1>j,rv+1v;u+1v;z~—1¥'0!ﬁ,

(28)

(539)

Where a, is independent of x, y, z, and t.

The function (29) of as, y, z, and t describes plane Waves in space-
time. We see from this example the suitability of the terms ‘Wave
function‘ and ‘Wave equation‘. The frequency of the Waves is

v = 117k, (30)

120 THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION §30

their wavelength is

A = RKPLEJrPLLFPEF‘ = h/P’, (31)

P’ being the length of the vector (p;,p;,,p;), and their motion is in
the direction specified by the vector (pgmpéqag) with the velocity

A.» = H’/P' = C2/V', (32)

v' being the velocity of the particle corresponding to the momentum

(pg, 19;, 19;) as given by formula (26). Equations (30), (31), and (32)

are easily seen to hold in all Lorentz frames of reference, the expres-
sion on the right-hand side of (29) being, in fact, relativistically
invariant "with 19;, p2,, p; and H ’ as the components of a 4-vector.
These properties of relativistic invariance led de Broglie, before the
discovery of quantum mechanics, to postulate the existence of waves
of the form (29) associated with the motion of any particle. They
are therefore known as de Broglie waves.

In the limiting case when the mass m is made to tend to zero, the
classical velocity of the particle v becomes equal to c and hence, from
(32), the wave velocity also becomes c. The waves are then like the
light-waves associated with a photon, with the difference that they
contain no reference to the polarization and involve a complex ex-
ponential instead of sines and cosines. Formulas (30) and (31) are
still valid, connecting the frequency of the light-waves with the
energy of the photon and the wavelength of the light-waves with
the momentum of the photon.

For the state represented by (29), the probability of the particle
being found in any specified small volume when an observation of its
position is made is independent of where the volume is. This provides
an example of Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty, the state being
one for which the momentum is accurately given and for which, in
consequence, the position is completely unknown. Such a state is,
of course, a limiting case which never occurs in practice. The states
usually met with in practice are those represented by wave packets,
which may be formed by superposing a number of waves of the type
(29) belonging to slightly different values of (p5,, gﬂppg), as discussed
in § 24. The ordinary formula in hydrodynamics for the velocity of
such a wave packet, i.e. the group velocity of the waves, is

This is just the velocity-of the particle. The Wave packet moves in
the same direction and With the same velocity as the particle moves
in classical mechanics.
