#47. The anomalous Zeeman effect

One of the simplest examples of the perturbation method of § 43
is the calculation of the first-order change in the energy-levels of an
atom caused by a uniform magnetic field. The problem of a hydrogen
atom in a uniform magnetic field has already been dealt with in § 41
and Was so simple thatperturbation theory was unnecessary. The
case of a general atom is not much more complicated when We make
a few approximations such that We can set up a simple model for the
atom.

We ﬁrst of all consider the atom in the absence of the magnetic
field and look for constants of the motion or quantities that are
approximately constants of the motion. The total angular momen-
tum of the atom, the vector j say, is certainly a constant of the
motion. This angular momentum may be regarded as the sum of two
parts, the total orbital angular momentum of all the electrons, 1 say,
and the total spin angular momentum, s say. Thus We have j = l-l-s.
Now the effect of the spin magnetic moments on the motion of the
electrons is small compared with the effect of the Coulomb forces and
may be neglected as a first approximation. With this approximation
the spin angular momentum of each electron is a constant of the
motion, there being no forces tending to change its orientation. Thus
s, and hence also 1, will be constants of the motion. The magnitudes,
l, s, andj say, of l, s, andj will be given by

l+12~ﬁ = (li+l§+l§+i%*>*,
sH-h = (si+8§+@§+i%*)t

corresponding t0 equation (39) of § 36. They commute with each
other, and from (47) of § 36 we see that with given numerical values
for l and s the possible numerical values for j are

1+3, Z-l-swli, ..., [Z-—s[.

Let us consider a stationary state for which I, s, and j have deﬁnite
numerical values in agreement with the above scheme. The energy
of this state will depend on I, but one inight think that with neglect
of the spin magnetic moments it would be independent of s, and
also of the direction of the vector s relative to l, and thus of j. It will
be found in Chapter IX, however, that the energy depends very much
on the magnitude s of the vector s, although independent of its
direction when one neglects the spin magnetic moments, on account
of certain phenomena arising from the fact that the electrons are
indistinguishable one from another. There are thus different energy-
levels of the system for each different value of 1 and s. This means
that I and s are functions of the energy, according to the general
definition of a function given in § 1 1, since the l and s of a stationary
state are ﬁxed when the energy of that state is ﬁxed.

We can now take into account the effect of the spin magnetic
moments, treating it as a small perturbation according to the method
of § 43. The energy of the unperturbed system will still be approxi-
mately a constant of the motion and hence l and s, being functions
of this energy, will still be approximately constants of the motion.
The directions of the vectors l and s, however, riot being functions of
the unperturbed energy, need not now be approximately constants
of the motion and may undergo large secular variations. Since the
vector j is constant, the only possible variation of l and s is a pre-
cession about the vector j. We thus have an approximate model of
the atom consisting of the two vectors l and s of constant lengths
precessing about their sum j, "which is a ﬁxed vector. The energy is
determined mainly by the magnitudes of l and s and depends only
slightly on their relative directions, speciﬁed by j. Thus states with
the same 1 and s and different j will have only slightly different
energy-levels, forming what is called a multiplet terln.

Let us now take this atomic model as our unperturbed system and
suppose it to be subjected to a uniform magnetic ﬁeld of magnitude .11‘
in the direction of the z-axis. The extra energy due to this magnetic

ﬁeld will consist of a term
eﬂ/Zwzc. (mz-i-iiaz), (41)

like tlie last term in equation (89) of §4l, contributed by each
electron, and will thus be altogether

eﬂ/Qmc. Z (ma-Hing) = eﬂ/Qmcudz-l-Qsz) = eﬂ/QmcJjZ-l-sz). (42)
This is our perturbing energy V. We shall now use the method of
§ 43 to determine the changes in the energy-levels caused by this V.
The method will be legitimate only provided the ﬁeld is so weak that
V is small compared with the energy differences within a multiplet.

Our unperturbed system is degenerate, on account of the direction

of the vector j being undetermined. We must therefore take, from
the representative of V in a Heisenberg representation for the un-
perturbed system, those matrix elements that refer to one particular
energy-level for their row and column, and obtain the eigenvalues of
the matrix thus formed. We can do this best by first splitting up V
into two parts, one of which is a constant of the unperturbed motion,
so that its representative contains only matrix elements referring to
the same unperturbed energy-level for their row and column, while
the representative of the other contains only matrix elements refer-
ring to two different unperturbed energy-levels for their row and
column, so that this second p_art does not affect the first-order per-
turbation. The term involving j, in (42) is a constant of the un-
perturbed motion and thus belongs entirely to the first part. For the
term involving s, we have

 :3 jz(3xjx+8yjy+8zjz) +.(Szjx_"jz  (Szjy “i? syn‘?

The first term in this expression for sz is a constant of the unperturbed
motion /and thus belongs entirely to the first part, while the second
term, as we shall now see, belongs entirely to the second part.
Corresponding to (44) we can introduce
y, = Zzsy-Zysx.
It can now easilybe verified that

jzyzn+jyyy+jzyz = O

These relations connecting jx, j,, j, and 3/9,, 32y, y, are of the same form
as the relations connecting m, my, m, and x, y, z in the calculation
in § 4O of the selection rule for the matrix elements of z in a repre-
sentation with k diagonal. From the result there obtained that all
matrix elements of z vanish except those referring to two k values
differing by i6, we can infer that all matrix elements of 31,, and
similarly of ya, and yy, in a representation with j diagonal, vanish
except those referring to two j values differing by i6. The coeffi-
cients of yx and yy in the second term on the right-hand side of (43)
commute with j, so the representative of the whole of this term will
contain only matrix elements referring to two j values differing by
53%, and thus referring to two different energy-levels of the unper-
turbed system.

Hence the perturbing energy V becomes, when we neglect that
part of it whose representative consists of matrix elements referring
to two different unperturbed energy-levels,

61*‘ - J'(j+?i)—l(l+?i)+8(8+%)
%a.{1+ 23.0%,) . e5)
The eigenvalues of this give the first-order changes in the energy-
levels. We can make the representative of this expression diagonal
by choosing our representation such that j, is diagonal, and it then
gives us directly the first-order changes in the energy-levels caused by
the magnetic field. This expression is known as Landé’s formula.
The result (45)holds only provided the perturbing energy V is small
compared with the energy differences within a multiplet. For larger
values of V a more complicated theory is required. For very strong
fields, however, for which Vis large compared with the energy differ-
ences within a multiplet, the theory is again very simple. We may
now neglect altogether the energy of the spin magnetic moments for
the atom with no external field, so that for our unperturbed system
the vectors l and s themselves are constants of the motion, and not
merely their magnitudes Z and s. Our perturbing energy V, which is
still eJ#/2mo.(j,+s,), is now a constant of the motion for the unper-
turbed system, so that its eigenvalues give directly the changes in the
energy-levels. These eigenvalues are integral or half-odd integral
multiples of eﬂﬁ/Zmc according to whether the number of electrons
in the atom is even or odd.
