#78. Electrons and positrons by themselves

We now consider electrons and positrons in the absence of electro-
magnetic ﬁeld. The state of an electron is described, as in Chapter XI,
by a wave function 5b with four components ab‘, (a= 1, 2, 3, 4), satis-
fying the wave equation

13?; g”; z mm cxrg-i-r-kammyb. - (66)
To get a many-electron theory we shall apply the method of second
quantization of § 65, which involves changing the one-electron wave
function into a set of operators satisfying certain anticommutation
relations.

When we are dealing with 5b at various places at a given time we
may write it 3b,‘, with X denoting x,, x2, x3. Its components are then
ybux. We pass to the momentum representation with the wave function
9b,, by a three-dimensional Fourier resolution

5px I he f eﬂXlﬂ/ﬁlﬁp d3 , ¢p = he J‘ e-s<xp>ln¢x d393, (67)

3b,, has four components gbap, corresponding to the four components
of 5b,‘. In this representation the energy operator is

1b Z arpr+05n1mv

in which the momentum operators p, are multiplying factors.
We can separate 5b into a positive-energy part 5 and a negative-

energy part Q, 5h z 5+‘;

f and § each having four components like 5b. In the momentum
representation they are given by

1 o: Q9 +0: ‘m

since these equations lead to

and similarly 15g!) = _(p2-|-m2)*§p,
showing that 5p and {p are eigenfunctions of p0 with the eigenvalues
(p2+m2) * and — (p2+m2) *respectively. When one is working with
the operators

one should note that their squares are equal t0 themselves and their
product in either order is zero.

The second quantization makes the We into operators like the ifs
of § 65, satisfying anticommutation relations like (ll') of § 65. Using
the notation for the anticommutator

According to the interpretation of § 65, the operators qbap are
operators of annihilation of an electron of momentum p and the
operators Jap are operators of creation of an electron of momentum p.
To avoid the unphysical notion of negative-energy electrons, We must
pass over to a new interpretation based on the positron theory of § 73.
The annihilation of a negative-energy electron is to be understood as
the creation of a hole in the sea of negative-energy electrons, or the
creation of a positron. So the operators ﬁap become operators of
creation of a positron. The positron has the momentum — p, because
an amount p of momentum gets annihilated. Similarly the Zap become
operators of annihilation of a positron of momentum --p. The 5,,
and ﬁap are operators of annihilation and creation respectively of an
ordinary, positive-energy electron of momentum p.

It should be noted that, although 5p has four components, only
two of them are independent, because the four are connected by

1_  5 2 0
(P2+m2)* p ’
which involves two independent equations. The two independent
components of £1, ‘correspond to the annihilation of an electron in
each of the two independent states of spin. Similarly Q1, has only
two independent components, because of the equations

and they correspond to the creation of a positron in the two inde-
pendent states of spin.

The vacuum state, for which there are no electrons or positrons

present, is represented by the ket |0P) satisfying

fapl0p> -'"= 9» Zﬂplop) E 0- (74)
We can use this ket as the standard ket of a representation. We then
have any ket expressed as

Lldwgapa Cap) IOP):

in which the function, or rather functional, ‘P’ is a power series in the
variables 5a,, Zap. Each term of ‘I’ is like (l7') of§ 65. It must not
contain any of its variables to a higher power than'the first. It corre-
sponds to the existence of certain (positive-energy) electrons and
certain positrons, in states specified by the labels of the variables
appearing ‘in it.

From (l2') of § 65, the total number of electrons is flap 1b,‘, d3p
summed over a. We may write it in the notation of equation (12) of
§ 67 as f 5F}, 1/1,, d3p. Transforming it to the X-representation by (67),

we get
h-s ‘UT e-i(ifv)lne-wl(x'p-)la ‘ﬁx, dsxGpxIda x f  lbx dam,
showing that the density of the electrons is  glrx. This result includes
an infinite constant representing the density of the sea of negative-
energy electrons.

We get a quantity of more physical significance if we take the total

charge Q, equal to the number of positive-energy electrons minus the
number of holes or positrons, all multiplied by —e. Thus

Q = -@ f (égigg-ztip) dsp- <15)

We can evaluate this with the help of (68). Using the transpose of
the second of these equations, namely

relations (71) give

a result which We may assume- still holds for p' = p. Then the
expression for Q reduces to

Q = -@ j %(LZ‘-L¢p-T¢I)$p) (1311
Transforming it to the X-representation as before, We get
Q = --e f %@i¢x“¢ilzx) m,
showing that the charge density is

The interpretation of the one-electron Wave function in § 68 gives,
besides the probability density 92w, a probability current Jlarqb.
With second quantization We shall have correspondingly a ﬂow of
electrons, given by the operator  0a,. 50x. The sea of negative-energy
electrons produces no resultant ﬂow of electrons, from symmetry,
and'so the electric current is

The total energy of the electrons is, from formula (29)of§ 60, which
is valid also for fermions,

This total energy contains an infinite numerical term representing
the energy of the sea of negative-energy electrons.
We get a quantity of more physical signiﬁcance if We take the energy

of all the electrons and positrons, reckoning the energy of the vacuum
as zero. This quantity is

From (76), the ﬁrst integral in (82) is the same as (79) and is just
H)». The second integral is an inﬁnite constant and is minus the
energy of all the negative-energy electrons of the vacuum distribution.

We may take either H P or HP» as the Hamiltonian. The Heisenberg
equation of motion for nﬁax is thus

a¢axfax0 z [Qbaxr HP] x [hhlxigly]!

and if we work this out we just get back to the wave equation for 1L,
namely (66).

We must now look into the question of whether the theory is
relativistic. It is built up from operators 5b which satisfy the ﬁeld

equations (66). These equations are the same as the wave equation
for the one-electron wave function and are known to be invariant

under Lorentz transformations, provided 1,1: transforms according to
the law (20) of Chapter XI. Our present theory goes beyond the
one-electron theory in that anticommutation relations are introduced
for the We and rFs, and it becomes necessary to verify that these
anticommutation relations are Lorentz invariant.

We proceed by a method analogous to that of $75. We take two
general points X and X’ in space-time and form the anticommutator

Kabﬂlaw’) = ¢a(%)$b(w')+s5b(x')¢a(w)- (83)

We can evaluate it by working directly from the anticommutation
relations (7l)for the Fourier components of 1,1: and  A simpler way
is to note certain properties that Kab(x,x') must have, namely

(i) it involves w“ and w; only through their difference xF-azl;

§78 ELECTRONS AND POSITRONS BY THEMSELVES 297

(ii) it satisﬁes the wave equation

on account of (Mat) satisfying (66);
(iii) for x0 = x}, it has the value 8ab8(x-—x'), as follows from the

third of equations (70).

These properties are sufficientto ﬁx Kab(x, x’) completely, since (iii)
ﬁxes it for x0 = x5, (ii) shows how it depends on x0, and (i)then shows
how it depends on  The solution is easily seen to be

where the Z means a summation over the two values j; (p2+m2)* for
p0 with particular values forp, , p2, pa. It satisﬁes (ii)since the operator

in (84) produces the factor (po-ocrpr-ocmm) in the integrand of
(85), which factor gives zero when multiplied on the left into the

factor {  It satisfies (iii) since, with x0 = x1), the summation over p0

makes the second term in  cancel out.
The law of transformation for 1,1’ and l}; given in § 68 has the effect

of making the quantities $l(:t3')ozp1,b__(w) transform like the four com-

ponents of a 4-vector and making ¢l(X')<1m:/1(a:) invariant. Thus
l~¢‘*(w’>a,.¢<w>+si*<x'>am mm) <86)

is invariant with l!‘ any 4-vector and S any scalar. The invariance

of (86) must be sufficient to ensure the correct transformationlaw
for 9b and Q since it enables one to deduce the invariance of thk Wave

equation for 1,0, by taking Z1“ = M’, a/ﬁxp, S = —m.
The invariance of (86) leads to the invariance of

ThUS (Zita-FLT? 801m)!» Kbalx: x’)

would be sufficient to ensure the invariance of the anticommutation
