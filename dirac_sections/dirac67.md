#67. The Wave equation for the electron

Let us consider first the case of the motion of an electron in the
absence of an electromagnetic field, so that the problem is simply

§57 THE WAVE EQUATION FOR THE ELECTRON 255

that of the free particle, as dealt with in §30, with the possible
addition of internal degrees of freedom. The relativistic Hamiltonian
provided by classical mechanics for this system is given by equation
(23)of § 30, and leads to the wave equation

{P0—(m2c2+2v%+2@%+2»%)*}¢ = 0, (5)
where the p's are interpreted as operators in accordance with
(4). Equation (5), although it takes into account the relation between
energy and momentum required by relativity, is yet unsatisfactory
from the point of view of relativistic theory, because it is very un-
symmetrical between p0 and the otherp's, so much so that one cannot
generalize it in a relativistic way to the case when, there is a ﬁeld

present. We must therefore look for a new wave equation.
If we multiply the wave equation (5) on the left by the operator

{pﬁ-(mgca-i-pflrpg +19%}, we obtain the equation

{P3-~m2@”-—2Y>%—-21>%~z>§}¢ = 0, (6)
which is of a relativistically invariant form and may therefore more
conveniently be taken as the basis of a relativistic theory. Equation
(6)is not completely equivalent to equation (5) since, although every
solution of (5 )is also a solution of (6), the converse is not true. Only
those solutions of (6) belonging to positive values forpo are also
solutions of (5).

The wave equation (6) is not of the form required by the general
laws of the quantum theory on account of its being quadratic in p0.
In §27 we deduced from quite general arguments that the wave
equation must be linear in the operator 6/61? or p,, like equation (7)
of that section. We therefore seek a wave equation that is linear
in p0 and that is roughly equivalent to (6). In order that this wave
equation shall transform in a simple way under a Lorentz transforma-
tion, we try to arrange that it shall be rational and linear in p,, p2,
and p3 as vtell as in p,, and thuswf the form

{Po'"“"1¢1P1*O‘2P2'-'%Pa““ﬁ}¢ = 0, (7)

where the 03s and B are independent of the p's. Since we are consider-
ing the case of no field, all points in space-time must be equivalent,
so that the operator in the wave equation must not involve the X's.
Thus the a's and B must also be independent of the X's, so that they
must commute with the p's and the X's. They therefore describe
some new degree of freedom, belonging to some internal motion in

the electron. We shall see later that they bring in the spin of the
electron.

Multiplying (7)by the operator {p0—|—0:1p1+02p2+0¢3p3+ﬁ?} on the
left, we obtain

{Pii““%[°‘iPi+(°¢1 @2+°‘2 @1)P1P2+(@1l8+18°‘1)291]“l32i¢ z 0»

where 2 refers to cyclic permutations of the suffixes 1,- 2, 3. This is
123

the same as (6) if the 08s and )8 satisfy the relations
00% = 1, cxlocg-I-onaml T: 0,
1B2 I 777/252» 051 B-kﬂal I O» _
together with the relations obtained from these by permuting the
suffixes 1, 2, 3. If we write
)8 = 00m ma,
these relations may be summed up in the single one,
swab-gab 04a = 28Gb (a,b = 1, 2, 3, or m). (8)
The four a's all anticommute with one another and the square of
each is unity.

Thus by giving suitable properties to the 08s and B we can make
the wave equation (7) equivalent to (6), in so far as the motion of
the electron as a whole is concerned. We may now assume (7)is the
correct relativistic wave equation for the motion of an electron in
the absence of a field. This gives rise to one difficulty, however,
owing to the fact that (7), like (6), is not exactly equivalent to (5),
but allows solutions corresponding to negative as well as positive
values of p,. The former do not, of course, correspond to any actually
observable motion of an electron. For the present we shall consider
only the positive-energy solutions and shall leave the discussion of
the negative-energy ones to $73.

We can easily obtain a representation of the four a's. They lmve
similar algebraic properties to the 0’s introduced in §37, which o’s
can be represented by matrices xxrith two rows and columns. So long
as we keep to matrices with two rows and columns we cannot get a
representation of more than three anticommuting quantities, and we
have to go to four rows and columns to get a representation of the
four antiieommuting 08s. It is convenient first to express the a's in
terms of the 09s and also of a second similar set of three anticom-
muting variables whose squares are unity, p1, p2, p3 say, that are

§67 THE WAVE EQUATION FOR THE ELECTRON 257

independent of and commute with the u's. We may take, amongst
other possibilities,

‘*1 Z P161» ‘*2 i P1U2> ‘*3 z P1 Us» “m z Pa» (9)
and the a's will then satisfy all the relations (8), as may easily be

verified. If we now take a representation with p3 and 0'3 diagonal,
we shall get the following scheme of matrices:

0'1 r: O 1 O O 0'2 1*: O *2: O O 0'3 = 1 O 0 O
1 O O O i O O O O —-1 0 O
0 0 0 1 O 0 0 —:i O O 1 O
0 0 1 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 0 -
O O O 1 O O O --'i O 1 O O
1 0 0 0 i O 0 0 0 0 --1 0
0 ' 1 0 O 0 i 0 0 0 O 0 -—1 .
I t should be noted that the p’s and a's are all Hermitian, which makes

the 08s also Hermitian.

Corresponding to the four rows and columns, the wave function 1/1
must contain a variable that takes on four values, in order that the
matrices shall be capable of being multiplied into it. Alternatively,
we may look upon the wave function as having four components, each
a function only of the four afs. We saw in § 37 that the spin of the
electron requires the wave function to have two components. The
fact that our present theory gives four is due to our wave equation
(7) having twice as many solutions as it ought» to have, half of them
corresponding to states of negative energy.

With the help of (9), the wave equation (7) may be written with
three-dimensional vector notation

{Pix-Palm P)"Psm5i¢ I 9- (W)
To generalize this equation to the case when there is an electro-
magnetic field present, we follow the classical rule of replacing p0 and
p by po-l-e/c .A , and P-l-é/(LA, A , and A being the scalar and vector
potentials of the field at the place where the electron is. This gives
us the equation

{p0i+'f;A0H_-p1(c:  T": 0s 

which is the fundamental wave equation of the relativistic theory of
the electron.

The four components Ofgb in (10)or (l1)should be pictured as Written
one below another, so as to form a single-column matrix. The square
matrices p and 0' then get multiplied into the single-column matrix 1p
according to matrix multiplication, the product being in each case
another single-column matrix. The conjugate imaginary Wave func-
tion that represents a bra should be pictured as having its four com-
ponents Written one beside another, so as to form a single-row matrix,
which can be multiplied from the right by a square matrix p or 0' to give
another single-row matrix. We denote this conjugate imaginary Wave
function pictured as a single-row matrix by f‘, using the symbol l to
denote the transpose of any matrix, i.e. the result of interchanging
the rows and columns, Then the conjugate imaginary ofequation (ll)

tion operating to the left must be interpreted according to (24)of $22.
