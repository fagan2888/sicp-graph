#32. The action principle

Equation (10) shows that the Heisenberg dynamical variables at
time t, v), are connected with their values at time to, 21,0, or v, by a
unitary transformation. The Heisenberg variables at time t+8t are
connected with their values at time t by an infinitesimal unitary
transformation, as is shown by the equation of motion (l l) or (13),
which gives the connexion between 0H5; and v, of the form of (79) or
(80) of § 26 with H; for F and Sci/ii for e. The variation with time of
the Heisenberg dynamical variables may thus be looked upon as the
continuous unfolding of a unitary transformation. In classical
mechanics the dynamical variables at time t-l-St are connected with
their values at time t by an infinitesimal contact transformation and
the whole motion may be looked upon as the continuous unfolding of a
contact transformation. We have here the mathematical foundation
of the analogy between the classical and quantum equations of
motion, and can develop it to bring out the quantum analogue of all
the main features of the classical theory of dynamics.

Suppose we have a representation in which the complete set of
commuting observables E are diagonal, so that a basic bra is (fl.
We can introduce a second representation in which the basic bras are

<€'*| = <§'|T- (45)
The new basic bras depend on the time t and give us a moving
representation, like a moving system of axes in an ordinary vector
space. Comparing (45) with the conjugate imaginary of (8), we see
that the new basic vectors are just the transforms in the Heisenberg
picture of the original basic vectors in the Schrodinger picture, and
hence they must be connected with the Heisenberg dynamical

connected with the Schrodinger dynamical variables v. In particular,
each <§’*[ must be an eigenvector of the ifs belonging to the eigen-
values f’. It may therefore be written (5H, with the understanding
that the numbers f; are the same eigenvalues of the Efs that the "s
are of the §’s. From (45)we'get

of T in the original representation.
Differentiating ( 4 5 )with respect to t and using (6), we get

if we take for definiteness the case of continuous eigenvalues for the
f s. Now equation (5), written in terms of representatives, reads

Since (QIPQEZ) is the same function of the variables 5; and f; that
<§'|H l5”) is of 5' and 5”, equations (4 7)and (48) are of precisely the
same form, with the variables egg’; in (4 7) playing the role of the
variables 5’ and f" in (4 8) and the function (fﬂa) playing the role
of the function <§’|Pt). We can thus look upon (4 7)as a form of
Schrodinger's wave equation, with the function of; la) of the variables
5Q as the wave function. In this way Schrodinger's wave equation
appears in a new light, as the condition 0n the representative, in the
moving representation with the Heisenberg variables 5, diagonal, of the
ﬁxed ket corresponding to a state in the Heisenberg picture. The function
(ﬁﬂa) owes its variation with time to its left factor (ﬁl, in contra-
distinction to the function <5’ lPt), which owes its variation with time
to its right factor |Pt>.

factors, one for each [-variable, such as occurs for the variables

depending on to as well as on t. To get its dependence on to we take
the conjugate complex of equation (=19), interchange t and to and also
interchange single primes and double primes. This gives

The foregoing discussion of the transformation function <§§|§”) is
valid with the Es any complete set of commuting observables. The
equations were written down for the case of the §’s having continuous
eigenvalues, but they would still be valid if any of the <f’s have
discrete eigenvalues, provided the necessary formal changes are made
in them. Let us now take a dynamical system having a classical
analogue and let us take the g-"s to be the coordinates q. Put

<q£lq"> = sis“
and so define the function S of the variables gé, q". This function also
depends explicitly on t. (52) is a solution of Schrodinger's wave
equation and, if Ti can be counted as small, it can be handled in the
same way as (35) was. The S of (52) differs from the S of (35) on
account of there being no A in (52), which makes the S of (52) com-
plex, but the real part of this S equals the S of (35) and its pure
imaginary part is of the order ﬁ. Thus, in the limit %—> 0, the S of
(52) will equal that of (35) and will therefore satisfy, corresponding

and H, is the Hamiltonian of the classical analogue of our quantum
dynamical system. But (52) is also a solution of (51) with q's for Es,

variables q” or 9Q. This causes S to satisfy alsoT

where p; z —8S/8q;’.. (56)
The solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equations (53), (55) is the

action function of classical Inechanics for the time interval to to t,
i.e. it is the time integral of the Lagrangian L,

s = f L(t')dt’. (57)

Thus the S’ deﬁned by ( 5 2 )is the quantum analogue of the classical action
function and equals it in the Zinult h’, -+ 0. To get the quantum analogue
of the classical Lagrangian, we pass to the case of an inﬁnitesimal
time interval by putting t = tO-l-St and we then have <q;,,,3,,|q';,> as the
analogue of eiﬂhﬁsﬂﬁ. For the sake of the analogy, one should consider
L(to) as a function of the coordinates g’ at time to-l-Et and the co-
ordinates q” at time t,, rather than as a function of the coordinates
and velocities at time to, as one usually does.

The principle of least action in classical mechanics says that the
action function (5 7 )remains stationary for small variations of the tra-
jectory of the system which do not alter the end points, i.e. for small
variations of the q’s at all intermediate times between to and t with qt,
and q; ﬁxed. Let us see what it corresponds to in the quantum theory.

g}, being Written for 9Q, for brevity. At first sight there does not seem
t0 be any close correspondence between (59) and (60). We must,
however, analyse the meaning of (59) rather more carefully. We must
regard each factor B as a function of the q's at the two ends of the
time interval to which it refers. This makes the right-hand side of
(5 9)a function, not only of q, and q“, but also of all the intermediate
q's. Equation‘ (5 9) is valid only when we substitute for the inter-
mediate q's in its right-hand side their values for the real trajectory,
small variations in which values leave S stationary and therefore also,
from (58), leave B(t,t0) stationary. It is the process of substituting
these values for the intermediate q's which corresponds to the inte-
grations over all values for the intermediate q”s in (6 0). The quantum
analogue of the action principle is thus absorbed in the composition
law (60) and the classical requirement that the values of the inter-
mediate q’s shall make S stationary corresponds to the condition
in quantum mechanics that all values of the intermediate g”s
are important in proportion to their contribution to the integral
in (6 0).

Let us see how (59) can be a limiting case of (60) for 5 small. We
must suppose the integrand in (6 0)to be of the form aim”, where F is
a function of g5,q1,q;,...,q.,'n,q§ which remains continuous as f2 tends
to zero, so that the integrand is a rapidly oscillating function when
ﬁ is small. The integral of such a rapidly oscillating function will be
extremely small, except for the contribution arising from a region in
the domain of integration where comparatively large variations in
the q}, produce only very small variations in F. Such a region must
be the neighbourhood of a point where F is stationary for small varia-
tions of the g}, Thus the integral in (6 0)is determined essentially by
the value of the integrand at a point where the integrand is stationary
for small variations of the intermediate q”s, and so ( 60) goes over
into (59).

Equations (54) and (56) express that the variables qgp} are con-
nected with the variables g”,p” by a contact transformation and are
one of the standard forms of writing the equations of a contact trans-
formation. There is an analogous form for writing the equations of a
unitary transformationin quantum mechanics. We get from (52), with
the help of (45) of§ 22,

where f(g,) and g(g) are functions of the gfs and q's respectively. Let
G(q,,q) be any function of the gfs and q's consisting of a sum or

occur to the left of all the q's. Such a function we call mall ordered.
Applying (63) to each of the terms in G and adding or integrating,

Wg g“ <q;|@<q,,q>|q"> = G<q;,q"><q;|@">.
Now let us suppose each p, and P, can be expressed as a well-ordered

These equations are of the SELIIlB form as (54)and (56), but refer t0
the non-commuting quantum variables gbq instead of the ordinary
algebraic variables 9;, q". They show how the conditions for a unitary
transformation between quantum variables are analogousto the condi-
tions for a contact transformation between classical variables. The
analogy is not complete, however, because the classical S must be real
and there is no simple condition corresponding to this for the S of (64).
