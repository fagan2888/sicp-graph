#65. An assembly offermions
An assembly of fermions can be treated by a method similar to
that used in §§ 59 and 60’ for bosons. With the laets (1 ) we may use
the antisymmetrizing operator A defined by
A=u’!—iZiP» (9')
summed over all permutations P, the + or — sign being taken
according to whether P is even or odd. Applied to the ket (I )it gives

20'1"!’ 2 iplozfozg o¢§...o¢%.> = A|o¢“o¢bcx°...cx9>, (3')
a ket corresponding to a state for an assembly of u’ fermions. The

§65 AN ASSEMBLY OF FERMIONS 249

ket (3') is normalized provided the individual fermion kets {ma}, fab)...
are all different, otherwise it is zero. In this respect the ket (3') is
simpler than the ket (3). However, (3') is more complicated than (3)
in that (3') depends on the order in which a“, 00", 0",... occur in it,
being subject to a change of sign if an odd permutation is applied
to this order.

We can, as before, introduce the numbers n,, n2, n3,... of fermions
in the states a“), 0J2), 063),... and treat them as dynamical variables or
observables. They each have as eigenvalues only 0 and l. They form
a complete set of commuting observables for the assembly offermions.
The basic kets of a representation with the 927s diagonal may be taken
to be connected with the kets (3') by the equation

Afozacxboccmoag) =   (6')
corresponding to (6), the n”s being connected with the variables
00“, ab, 0f... by equation (4). The j; sign is needed in (6') since, for
given n”s, the occupied states a“, 0E’, 0",... are fixed but not their
order, so that the sign of the left-hand side of (6') is not fixed. To
set up a rule which determmes the sign in (6'), we must arrange all
the states 0¢ for a fermion arbitrarily in some standard order. The
06s occurring in the left-hand side of (6') form a certain selection from
all the 08s and the standard order for all the 06s will give a standard
order for this selection. We now make the rule that the + sign should
occur in (6') if the 08s on the left-hand side can be brought into their
standard order by an even permutation and the — sign if an odd
permutation is required. Owing to the complexity of this rule,
the representation with the basic kets In; né  is not a very
useful one.

If the number of fermions in the assembly is variable, we can set
up the complete set of kets

I), 10¢“), Ahxaa"), Ahxacxbuc), ..., (9')
corresponding to (9). A general ket is now expressible as a sum of
the various kets (9').

To continue with the development we introduce a set of linear
operators 17, ﬁ, one pair 17a, 6a corresponding to each fermion state cia,
satisfying the commutation relations

"70 W0+Wb “l0 = 0:
ﬁa- ﬁb+ﬁb Tia z 01 (11!)
"70 "?0+"?b 570 = 500-

250 THEORY OF RADIATION §65

These relations are like (11) with a + sign instead of a — on the left-
hand side. They show that, for a # b, 17a and ﬁg anticommute with
m, and 5b, while, putting b x a, they give

'03 == 0, 173m 0, ﬁana+7laﬁa = 1- (11")
To verify that the relations ( 11 ') are consistent, we note that linear
operators 1;, 1'3‘ satisfying the conditions (11') can be constructed in
the following “ray. For each state ca“ we take a set of linear operators
am, aya, am like the om, a”, 0,, introduced in § 37 to describe the spin
of an electron and such that am, 0W, am commute with a, ow, 6gb
for b 75 a. We also take an independent set of linear operators Q3,
one for each state 0:“, which all anticommute with one another and
have their squares unity, and commute with all the o variables.
Then, putting

a z %§a(Ua-a_“iUya)> 77a. z %ga(axa+iaya)a
we have all tbe conditions (11') satisfied.
From (11")

(na 77a? Z iqa ﬁr: "la. ﬁzz :2 '*7<1(1""'"’7a gab-Ta z 77-11502‘
This is an algebraic equation for 17a ﬁa, showing that 17a i], is an
observable with the eigenvalues 0 and 1. Also 11,, ﬁa commutes with
m, {y}, for b 75 a. These results allow us to put

17.11776; E new (12,)
the same as (12). From (11") we get now

the equation corresponding to (13).
Let us write the normalized laet which is an eigenket of all the n's
belonging to the eigenvalues zero as 10>. Then

showing that qﬂlll) is an eigenket of na belonging to the eigenvalue

unity. It is an eigenket of the other n 's belonging to the eigenvalues
zero, since the other n's commute xvith 27a. By generalizing the

§65 AN ASSEMBLY OF FERMIONS 251

argument we see that 17617,, pen/yum‘; is normalized and is a simul-
taneous eigenlret of all the n's, belonging to the eigenvalues unity
for n“, n,, nc,..., 1mg and zero for the other n's. This enables us t0 put

A]:x“a¢"oz”...o.7> = 17,,17b17c..rqa]{)>, (17,)

both sides being antisymmetrical in the labels a, 6, c,..., g. We have
here the analogue of (17).

If we pass over to a different set of basic kets {BA} for a fermion,
we can introduce a new set of linear operators 17A corresponding to
them. We then ﬁnd, by the same argument as in the case of bosons,
that the new 1fS are connected with the original ones by (21). This
shows that there is a procedure of second quantization for fermions,
similar to that for bosons, with the only difference that the commu-
tation relations (1 1') must be employed for fermions to replace the
commutation relations (11) for bosons.

A symmetrical linear operator UT of the form (22) can be expressed
in terms of the v7, 1‘; variables by a similar method to that used for
bosons. Equation (24) still holds, and so does (2 5) "with S replaced
by A. Instead of (26) we now have

UT 71x1 "Ire-WW = Z2 (-)"“*2a WE‘ nw17Yx="'l0><alUlxT>
Z g Th: g (“ymlllg-l 71x1 "?$,---|0>5bx,<@lUl5>=~ (26,)

7E1 meaning that the factor 17x, must be cancelled out, without its
position among the other qsfs being changed before the cancellation.
Instead of (27) we have

ﬁr» 77:61 ‘Ivy--  L: Z (“Y-lngl 77x1 17x2'"lO>8ba:,= (27')

so (28) holds unchanged and thus (29) holds unchanged. We have
the same final form (29) for UT in the fermion case as in the boson
case. Similarly, a symmetrical linear operator  of the form (30) can

be expressed as  T: gdqza nlxablmcﬁbﬁti 5c, (35,)
{I C

the same as one of the ways of writing (35).

The foregoing jwork shows that there is a deep-seated analogy
between the theory of fermions and that of bosons, only slight
changes having to be made in the general equations of the formalism

when one TJELSSBS from one to the other.
There is, however, a development of the theory of fermions that

has no analogue for bosons. For fermions there are only the two

 

252 THEORY OF RADIATION §65

alternatives of a state being occupied or unoccupied and there is
symmetry between these two alternatives. One can demonstrate the
symmetry mathematically by making a transformation which inter-

changes the concepts of ‘occupied’ and ‘unoccupied’, namely
"k

T): a ﬁzz’ ﬁr}. z ha:
W»? = 123175 L" 1-'”’“'
The creationloperators of the unstarred variables are the annihilation
operators of the starred variables, and vice versa. Thestarred variables
are now seen to satisfy the same quantum conditions and to have all
the same properties as the unstarred ones.,

If there are only a few unoccupied states, a convenient standard
ket to work with would be the one for which every state is occupied,

namely |0*> satisfying

"a|0*> = l9*>-
It thus satisfies n§|0*> = 0,
or ﬁrwio = o.
Other states for the assembly vivillicnow be represented by

12ml; vii-if"),
in which variables appear referring to the unoccupied fermioxl states
a, b, c... . We may look upon these unoccupied fermion states as holes
among the occupied ones and the 17* variables as the operators of
creation of such holes. The holes are just as much physical things
as the original particles and are also fermions.
