#71. Transition to polar variables

For the further study of the motion of an electron in a central field
of force with the Hamiltonian (38), it is convenient to make a
transformation to polar coordinates, as was done in §38 in the
non-relativistic case. We can introduce r and p, as before, but
instead of k, the magnitude of the orbital angular momentum m,
which is no longer a constant of the motion, we must now use the
magnitude of the total angular momentum M = 111+ ya. Let us put

3W = M§+Mg+zug+yza (39)

26s RELATIVISTIC THEORY OF THE ELECTRON §v1

The eigenvalues 0f m3 are integral multiples of ﬁ, those 0f $103 are
jjﬁ, and hence those of M3 must be half odd integral multiples of
(i. It follows from the theory of § 36 that the eigenvalues of ljl must
be integers greater than zero.

If in formula (32)we take B = C} = In, we get

(s, m?

n12+i(cr, in >< n1)

= Ina-Ma, In)

= (m+%?ia)2——-2?£(cr, nﬂ-ﬁﬁg.
Hence {(0,n1)—|—%}2 = M2+§='-%2.
Thus (o,m)-I-?€ is a quantity whose square is Mil-iii? and we could,
consistently with equation (39), deﬁne jﬁ as (a, mH-ﬁ. This would
not be the most convenient deﬁnition for j, however, since we would

like to have j a constant of the motion and (a,m)+1'i is not constant.
We have, in fact, from applications of (32),

(0, m)(0, p) = 'i(0, m >< p)
and (s, 11mm) T- aé, p >< he,
so that

(6: 111W, P)-|'(6= P)(°'= m) "T i123 U1{m239a""'{?7's392+292ms".@s m2}
Z i2 aleaiip, = -2?z($, p),
123
or {(6, means, PH-(s, pm new} m o.
Thus (a,m)+?i anticommutes with one of the terms in the expression
(38)for H, namely the term Cpl(6, p), and commutes with the other
two. It follows that p3{(c:, mH-ﬁ} commutes with all the three terms
in H and is a constant of the motion. But the square of p3{(0', mH-fi}

is also Mg-l-liég. “W e can therefore take
4

.771 = P3{(<n m)+?i»}> (40)
which gives us a convenient rational definition for j which is consis-
tent with (39) and makes j a constant of the motiori. The eigenvalues
of this j are all positive and negative integers, excluding zero.

By a further application of (32), we get
(6, X)(<=, P) x (X, P)+’5(°» m)
.1: ?*p,.+ip3j?i-—i?é, (41)
with the help of (40) and also of equation (58) of § 38. We introduce
the linear operator e defined by

Te = p1(G,  (42)

§71 TRANSITION TO POLAR VARIABLES 269

Since r commutes with p1 and with (0,x),it must commute with E.
We thus have
rZeZ = [p1(€$, x)]2 == (a, X)2 = x2 = r2,

OI‘ e2 x1.

Now p1(G, p) commutes with j, and since there is symmetry between
x and p so far as angular momentum is concerned, p1(a, x) must also
commute withj. Hence e commutes withj. Further, e must commute
with p,, since we have

(6, XXX, PP-(X, PM“, X) == (@1414, P)-(X= PW) = iﬁﬁfhX),
which gives TeTpr-hTprTe == iﬁre,
or rgepr-wapre z 0.
From (41) and (42) we obtain

reps-rap) = rpr+'ipajﬁ~'iﬁ,

or p1(O', p) = e(p,.—iii/r)+iep3j%/¢.
Thus (38) becomes

H/c l: —-—e/c . A0+€(pr——?:%/T)+?:€p3jﬁ/Y+p3 mo.

This gives our Hamiltonian expressed in terms of polar variables. It
should be noticed that e and p3 commute with all the other variables
occurring in H and anticommute with one another. This means that
we can take a representation with p3 diagonal in which e and p3 are
represented respectively by the matrices

0 --' 1 0
, K ~ <43)
z 0 0 -—~1
If r is also diagonal in the representation, the representative
<wpg|> of a ket will have two components, (r',1|> = wﬁah“) and

(r ', —1]> = $00“) say, referring to the two rows and columns of the
matrices (43).
