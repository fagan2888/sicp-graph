#59. An assembly 0f bosons

WE consider a dynamical system composed of u’ similar particles.
We set up a representation for one of the particles wvith discrete basic
kets IQJD), Id”), |a(3>>,.... Then, as explained in § 54, We get a sym-
metrical representation of‘the assembly of 2i,’ particles by taking as
basic kets the products

l@~<i‘>l@3>I@§>-»-|@£’,»> = |@r@2@§~~~@a»> <1)
in Which there is one factor for each particle, the suffixes 1, 2, 3,..., u’
of the 08s being the labels of the particles and the indices a, b, c,..., g
denoting indices (l), (2), “L... in the basic kets for one particle. If the
particles are bosons, so that only symmetrical states occur in nature,
then We need to work with only the symmetrical kets that can be
constructed from the kets (1). The states corresponding to these
symmetrical kets Will form a complete set of states for the assembly
of bosons. We can build up a theory of them as follows.

We introduce the linear operator S defined by

S=u’!"i'2P, (2)
the sum being taken over all the u’ Jpermutations of the u’ particles.

Then S applied to any ket for the assembly gives a symmetrical ket.

We may therefore call S the syzmietrizing operator. From (8) of $55
it is real. Applied to the ket (l)it gives

u’!—% g P]o¢i"cxgo¢§...o¢ﬂ»> = Slceaocbcxc-nag}, (3)
the labels of the particles being omitted on the right-hand side as
they are no longer relevant. The ket (3) corresponds to a state for
the assembly of u’ bosons With a deﬁnite distribution of the bosons
among the various boson states, Without any particular boson being
assigned to any particular state. The distribution of bosons is speci-
ﬁed if We specify how many bosons are in each boson state. Let
n1, n5,  be the numbers of bosons in the states 0J1), 0J2), 09),..-
respectively With this distribution. The n"s are defined algebraically
by the equation

O¢a+O3b+O£c~f-...+££g = nia(1)+n§a¢(2)+n§a(3)+... . (4)
The sum of the n"s is of course u’. The number of n”s is equal 150
the number of basic kets lam), Which in most applications of the‘

226 THEORY OF RADIATION §59

theory is very much greater than n’, so most of the n"s will be zero.
If m“, cab, o¢°,..., a“ are all different, i.e. if the n”s are all 0 or 1, the
ket (3) is normalized, since in this case the terms on the left-hand
side of (3) are all orthogonal to one another and each contributes
nil-l to the squared length of the ket. However, if a“, ab, oc°,..., a”
are not all different, those terms on the left-hand side of (3)will
be equal which arise from permutations P which merely interchange
bosons in the same state. The number of equal terms will be
n1! ng! nQLH, so the squared length of the ket (3) will be
<oz“cxbo¢°...o¢9]/S’2lozaczbozcumacg) = nil  . (5)
Por dealing with a general state of the assembly we can introduce
the numbers n1, n,, n3,... of bosons in the states 04(1), e52), 01(3),..-
respectively and treat the n's as dynamical variables or as observ-
able~.They have the eigenvalues 0, 1, 2,..., u'. The ket (3) is a
simultaneous eigenket of all the n's, belonging to the eigenvalues
n1, né,  The various kets (3) form a complete set for the
dynamical system consisting of u' bosons, so the n’s all commute
(see the converse to the theorem of $13). Further, there is only one
independent ket (3) belonging to any set of eigenvalues vzi, ng,  .
Hence the n's form a complete set of commuting observables. If we
normalize the kets (3) and then label the .resulting kets by the
eigenvalues of the n's to wrvhich they belong, i.e. if we put

(nil né! ngl...)"lis'loaacxbcxc...ocg> =  ‘n;  (6)
we get a set of kets In;  n§,...>, with the n”s taking on all non-negative
integral values adding up to u’, which kets will form the basic kets

of a representation with the n's diagonal.
The n's can be expressed as functions of the observables a,, a,,

a,,..., a,,, which define the basic kets of the individual bosons by
means of the equations

72a z Z 5oz, ca?» (7)
or the equations Z nafloi“) = 2 f (<11?) (8)

holding for any function f.

Let us now suppose that the number of bosons in the assembly is
not given, but is variable. This number is then a dynamical variable
or observable n, with eigenvalues 0, 1, 2,..., and the ket (3) is an
eigenket of u belonging to the eigenvalue u'. To get a complete
set of kets for our dynamical system we must now take all the

§59 AN ASSEMBLY 0F BOSONS 221

symmetrical kets (3) for all values of u'. We may arrange them in
order thus l), lac“), Slotaocb), Shtxacxboz"), ..., (9)

where ﬁrst is written the ket, with no label, corresponding to the
state with no bosons present, then come the kets corresponding to
states with one boson present, then those corresponding to states
with two bosons, and so on. A general state corresponds to a ket
which is a sum of the various kets (9). The kets (9) are all orthogonal
to one another, two kets referring to the same number of bosons being
orthogonal as before, and two referring to different numbers of bosons
being orthogonal since they are eigenkets of u belonging to different
eigenvalues. By normalizing all the kets (9), we get a set of kets like
(6) with no restriction on the n”s (i.e. each n’ taking on all non-
negative integral values) and these kets form the basic kets of a
representation with the n's diagonal for the dynamical system con-
sisting of a variable number of bosons.

If there is no interaction between the bosons and if the basic kets
Jaw), J 01(2))... correspond to stationary states of a boson, the kets (9)
will correspond to stationary states for the assembly of bosons. The
number u of bosons is now constant in time, but it need not be a
specified number, i.e. the general state is a superposition of states
with various values for u. If the energy of one boson is H(a), the
energy of the assembly will be

ZH(cx,.) = 291GB“ (10)

from (8), H“ being short for the number H (ma). This gives the
Hamiltonian for the assembly as a function of the dynamical

variables n.
