**Exercise 2.20.**  **Free rigid body**\
 Write and demonstrate a program that reproduces diagrams like
figure [2.3](book-Z-H-29.html#FIGURE_2.3)
(section [2.9.2](book-Z-H-29.html#%_sec_2.9.2)). Can you find
trajectories that are asymptotic to the unstable relative equilibrium on
the intermediate principal axis?

**Exercise 2.21.**  **Rotation of Mercury**\
 In the '60s it was discovered that Mercury has a rotation period that
is precisely 2/3 times its orbital period. We can see this resonant
behavior in the spin-orbit model problem, and we can also play with
nudging Mercury a bit to see how far off the rotation rate can be and
still be trapped in this spin-orbit resonance. If the mismatch in
angular velocity is too great, Mercury's rotation is no longer
resonantly locked to its orbit. Set ![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif) = 0.026 and
*e* = 0.2.

**a**.  Write a program for the spin-orbit problem so this resonance
dynamics can be investigated numerically. You will need to know (or,
better, show!) that *f* satisfies the equation

with

Notice that *n* disappears from the equations if they are written in
terms of a new independent variable ![](chap2-Z-G-D-22.gif) = *n* *t*.
Also notice that *a* and *R*(*t*) appear only in the combination
*a*/*R*(*t*).

**b**.  Show that the 3:2 resonance is stable by numerically integrating
the system when the rotation is not exactly in resonance and observing
that the angle ![](chap1-Z-G-D-19.gif) `-` (3/2) *nt* oscillates.

**c**.  Find the range of initial ![](chap1-Z-G-D-20.gif) for which this
resonance angle oscillates.
