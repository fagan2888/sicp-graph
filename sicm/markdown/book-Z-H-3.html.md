\`\`The author has spared himself no pains in his endeavour to present
the main ideas in the simplest and most intelligible form, and on the
whole, in the sequence and connection in which they actually originated.
In the interest of clearness, it appeared to me inevitable that I should
repeat myself frequently, without paying the slightest attention to the
elegance of the presentation. I adhered scrupulously to the precept of
that brilliant theoretical physicist L. Boltzmann, according to whom
matters of elegance ought be left to the tailor and to the cobbler.''

Albert Einstein, in *Relativity, the Special and General Theory*,
(1961), p. v
