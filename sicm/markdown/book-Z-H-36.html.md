The formulation of mechanics with generalized coordinates and momenta as
dynamical state variables is called the Hamiltonian formulation. The
Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics is equivalent to the Lagrangian
formulation; however, each presents a useful point of view. The
Lagrangian formulation is especially useful in the initial formulation
of a system. The Hamiltonian formulation is especially useful in
understanding the evolution, especially when there are symmetries and
conserved quantities.

For each continuous symmetry of a mechanical system there is a conserved
quantity. If the generalized coordinates can be chosen to reflect a
symmetry, then, by the Lagrange equations, the conjugate momentum is
conserved. We have seen that such conserved quantities allow us to
deduce important properties of the motion. For instance, consideration
of the energy and angular momentum allowed us to deduce that rotation of
a free rigid body about the axis of intermediate moment of inertia is
unstable, and that rotation about the other principal axes is stable.
For the axisymmetric top, we used two conserved momenta to reexpress the
equations governing the evolution of the tilt angle so that they involve
only the tilt angle and its derivative. The evolution of the tilt angle
can be determined independently and has simply periodic solutions.
Consideration of the conserved momenta has provided key insight. The
Hamiltonian formulation is motivated by the desire to focus attention on
the momenta.

In the Lagrangian formulation the momenta are, in a sense, secondary
quantities: the momenta are functions of the state space variables, but
the evolution of the state space variables depends on the state space
variables and not on the momenta. To make use of any conserved momenta
requires fooling around with the specific equations. The momenta can be
rewritten in terms of the coordinates and the velocities, so, locally,
we can solve for the velocities in terms of the coordinates and momenta.
For a given mechanical system, and a Lagrangian describing its dynamics
in a given coordinate system, the momenta and the velocities can be
deduced from each other. Thus we can represent the dynamical state of
the system in terms of the coordinates and momenta just as well as with
the coordinates and the velocities. If we use the coordinates and
momenta to represent the state and write the associated state derivative
in terms of the coordinates and momenta, then we have a self-contained
system. This formulation of the equations governing the evolution of the
system has the advantage that if some of the momenta are conserved, the
remaining equations are immediately simplified.

The Lagrangian formulation of mechanics has provided the means to
investigate the motion of complicated mechanical systems. We have found
that dynamical systems exhibit a bewildering variety of possible
motions. The motion is sometimes rather simple and sometimes very
complicated. Sometimes the evolution is very sensitive to the initial
conditions, and sometimes it is not. And sometimes there are orbits that
maintain resonance relationships with a drive. Consider the periodically
driven pendulum: it can behave more or less as an undriven pendulum with
extra wiggles, it can move in a strongly chaotic manner, or it can move
in resonance with the drive, oscillating once for every two cycles of
the drive or looping around once per drive cycle. Or consider the Moon.
The Moon rotates synchronously with its orbital motion, always pointing
roughly the same face to the Earth. However, Mercury rotates three times
every two times it circles the Sun, and Hyperion rotates chaotically.

How can we make sense of this? How do we put the possible motions of
these systems in relation to one another? What other motions are
possible? The Hamiltonian formulation of dynamics gives us much more
than the stated goal of expressing the system derivative in terms of
potentially conserved quantities. The Hamiltonian formulation provides a
convenient framework in which the possible motions may be placed and
understood. We will be able to see the range of stable resonance motions
and the range of states reached by chaotic trajectories, and discover
other unsuspected possible motions. The Hamiltonian formulation leads to
many additional insights.
