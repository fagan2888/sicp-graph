The motion of rigid bodies presents many surprising phenomena.

Consider the motion of a top. A top is usually thought of as an
axisymmetric body, subject to gravity, with a point on the axis of
symmetry that is fixed in space. The top is spun and in general executes
some complicated motion. We observe that the top usually settles down
into an unusual motion in which the axis of the top slowly precesses
about the vertical, apparently moving perpendicular to the direction in
which gravity is attempting to accelerate it.

Consider the motion of a book thrown into the
air.[^1^](#footnote_Temp_175) Books have three main axes. If we idealize
a book as a brick with rectangular faces, the three axes are the lines
through the centers of opposite faces. Try spinning the book about each
axis. The motion of the book spun about the longest and the shortest
axis is a simple regular rotation, perhaps with a little wobble
depending on how carefully it is thrown. The motion of the book spun
about the intermediate axis is qualitatively different: however
carefully the book is spun about the intermediate axis, it tumbles.

The rotation of the Moon is peculiar in that the Moon always presents
the same face to the Earth, indicating that the rotational period and
the orbit period are the same. Considering that the orbit of the Moon is
constantly changing because of interactions with the Sun and other
planets, and therefore its orbital period is constantly undergoing small
variations, we might expect that the face of the Moon that we see would
slowly change, but it does not. What is special about the face that is
presented to us?

A rigid body may be thought of as a large number of constituent
particles with rigid constraints among them. Thus the dynamical
principles governing the motion of rigid bodies are the same as those
governing the motion of any other system of particles with rigid
constraints. What is new here is that the number of constituent
particles is very large and we need to develop new tools to handle them
effectively.

We have found that a Lagrangian for a system with rigid constraints can
be written as the difference of the kinetic and potential energies. The
kinetic and potential energies are naturally expressed in terms of the
positions and velocities of the constituent particles. To write the
Lagrangian in terms of the generalized coordinates and velocities we
must specify functions that relate the generalized coordinates to the
positions of the constituent particles. In the systems with rigid
constraints considered up to now these functions were explicitly given
for each of the constituent particles and individually included in the
derivation of the Lagrangian. For a rigid body, however, there are too
many consituent particles to handle each one of them in this way. We
need to find means of expressing the kinetic and potential energies of
rigid bodies in terms of the generalized coordinates and velocities,
without going through the particle-by-particle details.

The strategy is to first rewrite the kinetic and potential energies in
terms of quantities that characterize essential aspects of the
distribution of mass in the body and the state of motion of the body.
Only later do we introduce generalized coordinates. For the kinetic
energy, it turns out a small number of parameters completely specify the
state of motion and the relevant aspects of the distribution of mass in
the body. For the potential energy, we find that for some specific
problems the potential energy can be represented with a small number of
parameters, but in general we have to make approximations to obtain a
representation with a manageable number of parameters.
