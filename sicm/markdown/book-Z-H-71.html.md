Closed-form solutions of dynamical systems can be found only rarely.
However, some systems differ from a solvable system by the addition of a
small effect. The goal of perturbation theory is to relate aspects of
the motion of the given system to those of the nearby solvable system.
We can try to find a way to transform the exact solution of this
approximate problem into an approximate solution to the original
problem. We can also use perturbation theory to try to predict
qualitative features of the solutions by describing the characteristic
ways in which solutions of the solvable system are distorted by the
additional effects. For instance, we might want to predict where the
largest resonance regions are located or the locations and sizes of the
largest chaotic zones. Being able to predict such features can give
insight into the behavior of the particular system of interest.

Suppose, for example, we have a system characterized by a Hamiltonian
that breaks up into two parts as follows:

where *H*~0~ is solvable and ![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif) is a small
parameter. The difference between our system and a solvable system is
then a small additive complication.

There are a number of strategies for doing this. One strategy is to seek
a canonical transformation that eliminates from the Hamiltonian the
terms of order ![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif) that impede solution -- this
typically introduces new terms of order ![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif)^2^. Then
one seeks another canonical transformation that eliminates the terms of
order ![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif)^2^ impeding solution, leaving terms of
order ![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif)^3^. We can imagine repeating this process
until the part that impedes solution is of such high order in
![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif) that it can be neglected. Having reduced the
problem to a solvable problem, we can reverse the sequence of
transformations to find an approximate solution of the original problem.
Does this process converge? How do we know we can ever neglect the
remaining terms? Let's follow this path and see where it goes.
