The book Dirac "Principles of Quantum Mechanics" is a classic book on par with Newton's principia

#I. The Principle of Superposition
page 3
In order to give an absolute meaning to size, such as is required for any theory of the ultimate structure of matter, we have to assume that there is a limit to the fineness of our powers of observation and the smallness of the accompanying disturbance -- a limit which is inherent in the nature of things and can never be surpassed by improved technique or increased skill on the part of the observer.

page 10
The reader may possibly feel dissatisified with the attempt in the two preceeding sections to fit in the existence of photons with the classical theory of light. He may argue that a very strange idea has been introduced -- the possibility of a photon being partly in each of two states of polarization, or partly in each of two separate beams -- but even with the help of this strange idea no satisfying picture of the fundamental single-photon processes has been given.
...
One may, however, extend the meaning of the word 'picture' to include any way of looking at the fundamental laws which makes their self-consistency obvious. With this extension, one may gradually acquire a picture of atomic phenomena by becoming familiar with the laws of the quantum theory.

page 14
the superposition that occurs in quantum mechanics is of an essentially different nature from any occuring in the classical theory, as is shown by the fact that the quantum superposition principle demands indeterminancy in the results of observations in order to be capable of a sensible physical interpretation. The analogies are thus liable to be misleading.

#II. Dynamical Variables and Observables
page 32
We have been discussing properties of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a real linear operator, but have not yet considered the question of whether, for a given real linear operator, any eigenvalues and eigenvectors exist, and if so, how to find them. This question is in general very difficult to answer.

((the motivation behind the delta function, page 39))
Now in general <X|Y> does not vanish, so in general <\epsilon'x|\epsilon'y> must be infinitely great in such a way as to make (29) non-vanishing and finite. The form of infinity required for this will be discussed in section 15

page 47 -- how we implement probability density
The average value of the function of \epsilon is just the probability, P_a say, of \epsilon having the value a.

#III. Representations
page 58, delta function.

#IV. The Quantum Conditions
!!!
page 85-87 Dirac's elegant derivation of the quantum poisson bracket
We assume the quantum P.B to satisfy all the conditions (2) to (6), it being now necessary that the order of the factors u_1 and u_2 in the first of equations (5) should be preserved throughout the equation, as in the way we have here written it, and similarly for the v_1 and v_2 in the second of equations (5).

page 91 -- how Dirac arrives at p = - id_q => pattern matching
Comparing this result with (1), we see that -i\hbar d/dq satisfies the same commutation relation with q that p does.

page 92-93 -- "gauge transform"

page 102-103 -- another way to arrive at momentum operator
the x-component of the total momentum of the system is i\hbar times the displacement operator d_x

!!!
page 106
It will be shown that, for a quantum dynamical system that has a classical analogue, unitary transformations in the quantum theory are the analogue of contact transformations in the classical theory.

#V. The Equations of Motion
page 116 stationary states
Thus the state always remains an eigenstate of the energy, and further, it does not vary with the time at all, since the direction of the ket |Pt> does not vary with the time. Such a state is called a stationary state.
