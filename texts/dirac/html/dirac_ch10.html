      <h1>X THEORY OF RADIATION</h1>
<h1>59. An assembly 0f bosons</h1>
<p>WE consider a dynamical system composed of u’ similar particles.
We set up a representation for one of the particles wvith discrete basic
kets IQJD), Id”), |a(3&gt;&gt;,.... Then, as explained in § 54, We get a sym-
metrical representation of‘the assembly of 2i,’ particles by taking as
basic kets the products</p>
<p>l@~<i‘>l@3&gt;I@§&gt;-»-|@£’,»&gt; = |@r@2@§~~~@a»&gt; &lt;1)
in Which there is one factor for each particle, the suffixes 1, 2, 3,..., u’
of the 08s being the labels of the particles and the indices a, b, c,..., g
denoting indices (l), (2), “L... in the basic kets for one particle. If the
particles are bosons, so that only symmetrical states occur in nature,
then We need to work with only the symmetrical kets that can be
constructed from the kets (1). The states corresponding to these
symmetrical kets Will form a complete set of states for the assembly
of bosons. We can build up a theory of them as follows.</p>
<p>We introduce the linear operator S defined by</p>
<p>S=u’!"i'2P, (2)
the sum being taken over all the u’ Jpermutations of the u’ particles.</p>
<p>Then S applied to any ket for the assembly gives a symmetrical ket.</p>
<p>We may therefore call S the syzmietrizing operator. From (8) of $55
it is real. Applied to the ket (l)it gives</p>
<p>u’!—% g P]o¢i"cxgo¢§...o¢ﬂ»&gt; = Slceaocbcxc-nag}, (3)
the labels of the particles being omitted on the right-hand side as
they are no longer relevant. The ket (3) corresponds to a state for
the assembly of u’ bosons With a deﬁnite distribution of the bosons
among the various boson states, Without any particular boson being
assigned to any particular state. The distribution of bosons is speci-
ﬁed if We specify how many bosons are in each boson state. Let
n1, n5,  be the numbers of bosons in the states 0J1), 0J2), 09),..-
respectively With this distribution. The n"s are defined algebraically
by the equation</p>
<p>O¢a+O3b+O£c~f-...+££g = nia(1)+n§a¢(2)+n§a(3)+... . (4)
The sum of the n"s is of course u’. The number of n”s is equal 150
the number of basic kets lam), Which in most applications of the‘</p>
<p>226 THEORY OF RADIATION §59</p>
<p>theory is very much greater than n’, so most of the n"s will be zero.
If m“, cab, o¢°,..., a“ are all different, i.e. if the n”s are all 0 or 1, the
ket (3) is normalized, since in this case the terms on the left-hand
side of (3) are all orthogonal to one another and each contributes
nil-l to the squared length of the ket. However, if a“, ab, oc°,..., a”
are not all different, those terms on the left-hand side of (3)will
be equal which arise from permutations P which merely interchange
bosons in the same state. The number of equal terms will be
n1! ng! nQLH, so the squared length of the ket (3) will be
&lt;oz“cxbo¢°...o¢9]/S’2lozaczbozcumacg) = nil  . (5)
Por dealing with a general state of the assembly we can introduce
the numbers n1, n,, n3,... of bosons in the states 04(1), e52), 01(3),..-
respectively and treat the n's as dynamical variables or as observ-
able~.They have the eigenvalues 0, 1, 2,..., u'. The ket (3) is a
simultaneous eigenket of all the n's, belonging to the eigenvalues
n1, né,  The various kets (3) form a complete set for the
dynamical system consisting of u' bosons, so the n’s all commute
(see the converse to the theorem of $13). Further, there is only one
independent ket (3) belonging to any set of eigenvalues vzi, ng,  .
Hence the n's form a complete set of commuting observables. If we
normalize the kets (3) and then label the .resulting kets by the
eigenvalues of the n's to wrvhich they belong, i.e. if we put</p>
<p>(nil né! ngl...)"lis'loaacxbcxc...ocg&gt; =  ‘n;  (6)
we get a set of kets In;  n§,...&gt;, with the n”s taking on all non-negative
integral values adding up to u’, which kets will form the basic kets</p>
<p>of a representation with the n's diagonal.
The n's can be expressed as functions of the observables a,, a,,</p>
<p>a,,..., a,,, which define the basic kets of the individual bosons by
means of the equations</p>
<p>72a z Z 5oz, ca?» (7)
or the equations Z nafloi“) = 2 f (&lt;11?) (8)</p>
<p>holding for any function f.</p>
<p>Let us now suppose that the number of bosons in the assembly is
not given, but is variable. This number is then a dynamical variable
or observable n, with eigenvalues 0, 1, 2,..., and the ket (3) is an
eigenket of u belonging to the eigenvalue u'. To get a complete
set of kets for our dynamical system we must now take all the</p>
<p>§59 AN ASSEMBLY 0F BOSONS 221</p>
<p>symmetrical kets (3) for all values of u'. We may arrange them in
order thus l), lac“), Slotaocb), Shtxacxboz"), ..., (9)</p>
<p>where ﬁrst is written the ket, with no label, corresponding to the
state with no bosons present, then come the kets corresponding to
states with one boson present, then those corresponding to states
with two bosons, and so on. A general state corresponds to a ket
which is a sum of the various kets (9). The kets (9) are all orthogonal
to one another, two kets referring to the same number of bosons being
orthogonal as before, and two referring to different numbers of bosons
being orthogonal since they are eigenkets of u belonging to different
eigenvalues. By normalizing all the kets (9), we get a set of kets like
(6) with no restriction on the n”s (i.e. each n’ taking on all non-
negative integral values) and these kets form the basic kets of a
representation with the n's diagonal for the dynamical system con-
sisting of a variable number of bosons.</p>
<p>If there is no interaction between the bosons and if the basic kets
Jaw), J 01(2))... correspond to stationary states of a boson, the kets (9)
will correspond to stationary states for the assembly of bosons. The
number u of bosons is now constant in time, but it need not be a
specified number, i.e. the general state is a superposition of states
with various values for u. If the energy of one boson is H(a), the
energy of the assembly will be</p>
<p>ZH(cx,.) = 291GB“ (10)</p>
<p>from (8), H“ being short for the number H (ma). This gives the
Hamiltonian for the assembly as a function of the dynamical</p>
<p>variables n.</p>
<ol>
<li>The connexion between bosons and oscillators</li>
</ol>
<p>In § 34 we studied the harmonic oscillator, a dynarnical system of
one degree of freedom describable in terms of a canonical q and p,
such that the Hanliltonian is a sum of squares of q and p, with
numerical coefficients. We define a general oscillator mathematically
as a system of one degree of freedom describable in terms of a
canonical q and p , such that ‘the Hamiltonian is a power series in q
and p, and remains so if the system is perturbed in any way. We
shall now study a dynamical system composed of several of these
oscillators. We can describe each oscillator in terms of, instead of
q and p, a complex dynamical variable '1], like the 17 of § 34, and its</p>
<p>22s THEORY OF ‘RADIATION §e0</p>
<p>conjugate complex $7", satisfying the commutation relation (7) of
§ 34. We attach labels 1, 2, 3,... to the different oscillators, so that
the whole set of oscillators is describable in terms of the dynamical
variables 1;], v72, n3,..., ﬁl, 152, 53,... satisfying the commutation</p>
<p>relations ___

so that '57} Va = "a-IJ- (13)</p>
<p>The n's are observables which commute with one another and the
Work of § 34 shows that each of them has as eigenvalues all non-
negative integers. For the ath oscillator there is a standard ket for
the Fock representation, 10a) say, which is a normalized eigenket of n,
belonging to the eigenvalue zero. By multiplying all these standard
kets together we get a standard ket for the Fock representation for
the set of oscillators, |O1&gt;|02&gt;|03&gt;m’ (l4)</p>
<p>which is a simultaneous eigenket of all the n's belonging to the
eigenvalues zero. We shall denote it simply by 10&gt;. From (13) of §34</p>
<p>ﬁal0&gt; = 0 (15)
for any a. The work of§34 also shows that, if n}, 92;, 11%,... are any
non-negative integers, 721,; ﬁg; ngaulw (16)</p>
<p>is a simultaneous eigenket of all the n's belonging to the eigenvalues
n}, 11;, 12.5,... respectively. The various kets (16) obtained by taking
(lifferent n"s form a complete set of kets all orthogonal to one another
and the square of the length of one of them is, from (16) of § 34,
n1!n§!n§,!=.... From this we see, bearing in mind the result (5), that
the kets (16) have just the same properties as the kets (9), so that
we can equate each ket (16) to the ket (9) referring to the same n'
values without getting any inconsistency. This involves putting</p>
<p>S|o¢“o¢boc°...o¢g&gt; = 7, T”, qc...'qg|()&gt;. (l7)</p>
<p>The standard ket j0&gt; becomes equal to the first of the kets (If), corre-
sponding to no bosons present.</p>
<p>The effect of equation (17) is to identify the states of an assembly
of bosons with the states of a set’ of oscillators. This means that the</p>
<p>§ﬁO CONNFIXION BE'I.‘VV'EPIN BOSONS AND OSCILLATORS 229</p>
<p>dynamical system, consisting 0f an assembly of similar bosons is equiva-
lent to the dynamical system consisting of a set of oscillators-the two
systems are just the sante system looked at from two diﬁerent points of
view. There is one oscillator associated with each independent boson
state. We have here one of the most fundamental results of quantum
mechanics, which enables a uniﬁcation of the wave and corpuscular
theories of light to be effected.</p>
<p>Our Work in the preceding-section was built up on a discrete set
of basic kets Ia“) for a boson. We could pass to a different discrete
set of basic kets, 1B1‘) say, and build up a similar theory on them.
The basic kets for the assembly would then be, instead of (9),</p>
<p>l&gt;, I5A&gt;&gt; Slﬁfﬁﬁb, SIBABBBOX  (18)</p>
<p>The first of the kets (18), referring to no bosons present, is the same
as the ﬁrst of the lasts (9). Those kets (18) referring to one boson
present are linear functions of those kets (9) referring to one boson</p>
<p>present, namely 778% = 2 laa&gt;<aa|ﬁA>y (19)</p>
<p>and generally those kets (18) referring to u’ bosons present are linear
functions of those kets (9)referring to 1t’ bosons present. Associated
with the new basic states ISA) for a boson there will be a new set
of oscillator variables 17 A, and corresponding to (17) we shall have</p>
<p>SIBABBBU~&gt; = <em>2.u211</em>1o-~-l0&gt;- (20)</p>
<p>Thus a ket 17A 17B... 10&gt; with u’ factors 17A, 173,... must be a linear func-
tion of kets 17,,17;,...|0&gt; with u’ factors 17a, 17,,,.... It follows that each
linear operator 17 A must be a linear function of the 17,,’s. Equation</p>
<p>(19) gm 11|&lt;&gt;&gt; = g na|"&gt;<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#64;&#8220;&#124;&#64257;&#8216;&#42;">&#64;&ldquo;&#124;&#64257;&lsquo;&#42;</a>
and hence 17A Z 2 Wtﬂaal/QA} (21)</p>
<p>Thus the 17’s transform according to the same 11w as the basic kets for
a boson. The transformed 17’s satisfy, with their conjugate complexes,
the same commutation relations (11) as the original ones. The trans-
formed 17’s are on just the same footing as the original ones and hence,
when we look upon our dynamical system as a set of oscillators, the
different degrees of freedom have no invariant significance.</p>
<p>The 1‘7"s transform according to the same law as the basic bras for
a boson, and thus the same law as the numbers (aaléli) forming the</p>
<p>representative of a state x. This similarity people often describe by
3595.57
Q</p>
<p>230 THEORY OF RADIATION §60</p>
<p>saying that the ﬁcfs are given by a process of second quantization
applied. t0 (aalx), meaning thereby that, after one has set up a
quantum theory for a single particle and so introduced the numbers
(aalx) representing a state of the particle, one can make these num-
bers into linear operators satisfying with their conjugate complexes
the correct commutation relations, like (11), and one then has the
appropriate mathematical basis for dealing with an assembly of the
particles, provided they are bosons. There is a corresponding proce-
dure for fermions, which will be given in § 65.</p>
<p>Since an assembly of bosons is the same as a set of oscillators, it
must be possible to express any symmetrical function of the boson
variables in terms of the oscillator variables -q and f}. An example
of this is provided by equation (10) with '17,, 1'), substituted for n“.
Let us see how it goes in general. Take first the case of a function
of the boson variables of the form</p>
<p>UT = g (In (22)</p>
<p>where each f], is a function only of the dynamical variables of the
rth boson, so that it has a representative (oaﬂaloc?) referring to the
basic kets la?) of the rth boson. In order that UT may be symmetrical,
this representative must be the same for all r, so that it can depend
only on the two eigenvalues labelled by a and b. We may therefore</p>
<p>We f“ oslraw = &lt;&lt;&gt;&lt;“IUIQ=”&gt; = civic &lt;28)
for brevity. We have
@105? 05$...) = 2 |cxf10¢§’*..o¢§..&gt;<a[U|xf>. (24)</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>Summing this equation for all values of '2' and applying the sym-
metrizing operator S to both sides, we get</p>
<p>SUTkxf‘  = Z 2 81oz? o&lt;:§=..o:f..&gt;<a|U|a¢,.>. (25)</p>
<p>Since UT is symmetrical we can replace SUT by UT S and can then
substitute for the symmetrical kcts in (25)their values given by (17).
We get in this way</p>
<p>UT 77x177x2"'i0&gt; = E Z m 12;.‘ "u. at,» 10X“! UI&lt;&gt;~=¢&gt;
= § m Z m? 17x177xg"'|O&gt;8bx,<a|(]ib>: (26)</p>
<p>n; meaning that the factor 17x, must be cancelled out. Now from
(15) and the commutation relations (11)</p>

<p>The method can readily be extended to give any symmetrical func-
tion of the boson variables in terms of the vfs and is.</p>
<p>The foregoing theory can easily be generalized to apply to an
assembly of bosons in interaction with some other dynamical system,
which We shall call for definiteness the atom. We must introduce a
set of basic kets, IE’) say, for the atom alone. We can then get a set
of basic kets for the Whole system of atom and bosons together by
multiplying each of the kets f?) into each of the kets (9). We may

<p>232 THEORY OF RADIATION §60</p>
<p>We may look upon the system as composed of the atom in interaction
with a set of oscillators, so that it can be described in terms of the
atom variables and the oscillator variables 17a, i“. Using again the
standard ket l0) for the set of oscillators, we have</p>
<p>Sl€!05a°4bmc*"&gt; = 77a rib 720" !0&gt; |gl&gt;r (37)
corresponding to (17), as the equation expressing the basic kets
(36) in terms of the oscillator variables.</p>
<p>Any function of the atom variables and boson variables which is
symmetrical between all the bosons is expressible as a function of the
atom variables and the vfs and ﬁe. Consider first a function Q. of
the form (22) with U, a function only of the atom variables and the
variables of the rth boson, so that it has arepresentative &lt;§’a§.‘| U, {Hui}.
This representative must be independent of r in order that UT may
be symmetrical between all the bosons, so we may write it</p>

still holds. We can dsal similarly with a symmetrical function  of

function of the atom variables whose representative is</p>

we find that formula (35) still holds.</p>
<ol>
<li>Emission and absorption of bosons</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us suppose that the oscillators of the preceding section are
harmonic oscillators and there is no interaction between them. The
energy of the ath oscillator is then, from (5)of § 34,</p>
<p>Ha = ﬁwa 77a ﬁa+éﬁwa°
We shall neglect the constant term 3-1ﬂiwa, which is the energy of the
oscillator in its lowest state—the so-called ‘zero-point energy’. This
neglect does not have any dynamical consequences, as explained at</p>
<p>the beginning of § 30, and merely involves a redefinition of Ha. The
total energy of all the oscillators is now</p>

a a a</p>
<p>§51 EMISSION AND ABSORPTION OF BOSONS 233</p>
<p>With the help of (I2). This is of the same form as (10), With iiwa for
H“. Thus a set 0f barf/tonic osciliators is equivalent to an assembly of
bosons in stationary states with no interaction between them. If an
oscillator of the set is in its n'th quantum state, there are n’ bosons in
the associated boson state.</p>
<p>In general the Hamiltonian for the set of oscillators will be a power
series in the variables ha, 5a, say</p>
<p>HT z: HP+ 2 (UaqiaTiT Uaﬁai-l” l; (Uab naﬁb+gzb7ia7ib+lzbﬁaﬁbi+~w</p>
<p>(40)
Where HP, U“, Uab, 171,, are numbers, HP being real and Uab = ma. If
the set of oscillators are in interaction with an atom, as We had at
the end of the preceding section, the total Hamiltonian will still be
of the form (40), With H , If“, Uab, IQ, functions of the atom variables,
HP in particular being ths Hamiltonian for the atom by itself. A
general treatment of this dynamical system Would be rather compli-
cated and for practical applications one assumes that the terms</p>
<p>HP+ 2 Uaa Haﬁz: (41)</p>
<p>are large compared With the others and form by themselves an
unperturbed system, the remaining terms being taken into account
as a perturbation producing transitions in the unperturbed system,
according to the theory of § 44. If, further, Um is independent of the
atom variables, the unperturbed system with Hamiltonian (41) con-
sists merely of an atom with Hamiltonian HP and an assembly of
bosons in stationary states with Hainiltonian of the form (39), with
no interaction.</p>
<p>Let us consider What kinds of transitions are produced by the
various perturbation terms in (40). Take a stationary state of the
unperturbed system for which the atom is in a stationary state, Z’ say,</p>
<p>and bosons are present in the stationary boson states, a, b, 0,... . This
stationary state for the unperturbed system corresponds to the ket
Tia 71b 7lc'"iO&gt;iC!&gt;&gt; </p>
<p>like (37). If the term U; 1% of (4 0) is multiplied into this ket, the
result is a Iinear combination of kets like</p>
<p>"71: 71a 77b 770'" io&gt;gﬁ&gt;s </p>
<p>ﬁ" denoting any stationztry state of the atom. The ket (4 3) refers to
one more boson than the ket (42), the extra boson being in the states.</p>
<p>234 THEORY OF RADIATION §51</p>
<p>Thus the perturbation term Um 17,, gives rise t0 transitions in which
one boson is emitted into state x and the atom. makes an arbitrary
jump. If the term ﬁx ﬁx of (40) is multiplied into r42), the result is
zero unless (42) contains a factor 17,. and is then a linear combination</p>
<p>Of kOtS  Tlg-lﬂa 77b no".  l§rr&gt;,</p>
<p>referring to one boson less in state x. Thus the perturbation term
‘(Ta ﬁx gives rise to transitions in which one boson is absorbed from
state x, the atom again making an arbitrary jump. Similarly, we ﬁnd
that a perturbation term U,” 17,, 5,, (X ¢ y) gives rise to processes in
which a boson is absorbed fIOHl state y and one is emitted into state
x, or, what is the same thing physically, one boson makes a transition
from state y to state x. This kind of process would be produced by
a term like the UT of (22) and (29) in the perturbation energy, pro-
vided the diagonal elements (a) U|a&gt; vanish. Again, the perturbation
terms Véy 17,, n”, T7,,” ﬁx '51, give rise to processes in which two bosons are
eniitted or absorbed, and so on for more complicated terms. With</p>
<p>any of these emission and absorption processes the atom can make.</p>
<p>an arbitrary jump.
Let us determine how the probability of occurrence of each of these</p>
<p>. transition processes depends on the numbers of bosons originally</p>
<p>present in the various boson states. From §§ 44, 46 the transition
probability is always proportional to the square of the modulus of
the matrix element of the perturbation energy referring to the two
states concerned. Thus the probability of a boson being emitted into
state x with the atom making a jump from state Q’ to state C” is
proportional to</p>
<p>I&lt;€”I<n1né~(n;+1)--ll7$ nan; n;~n;.-->rc’&gt;|% &lt;44)

<ol>
<li>Application to photons</li>
</ol>
<p>Since photons are bosons, the foregoing theory can be applied to
them. A photon is in a stationary state when it is in an eigenstate
of momentum. It then has two independent states of polarization,
which may be taken to be two perpendicular states of linear polariza-
tion. The dynamical variables needed to describe the stationary
states are then the momentum p, a vector, and a polarization variable
1, consisting of a unit vector perpendicular to p. The variables p and
1 take the place of our previous ds. The eigenvalues of p consist of
all numbers from ~00 to o0 for each of the three Cartesian com-
ponents of p, while for each eigenvalue p' of p, 1 has just two
eigenvalues, namely’ two arbitrarily chosen vectors perpendicular
to p' and to one another. Owing to the eigenvalues of p forming
a continuous range, there are a continuous range of stationary
states, giving us the continuous basic kets ]p’l’). However, the fore-
going theory was built up in terms of discrete basic kets Ia’) for a
boson. There are two formalisms which one may use for getting over
this discrepancy.</p>
<p>23s THEORY 0F RADIATION §a2</p>
<p>The first consists in replacing the continuous three-dimensional
distribution of eigenvalues for p by a- large number of discrete points
lying very close together, forming a dust spread over the Whole three-
dimensional p-space. Let s, be the density of the dust (the number
of points per unit volume) in the neiglibourhood of any point p‘.
Then s9» must be large and positive, but is otherwise an arbitrary
function of p‘. An integral over the p-space may be replaced by a
sum over the dust of points, in accordance with the formula</p>
<p>f f f fun d1»; dPLdP; = 2f&lt;p*)s;-1» &lt;52)</p>
<p>Which formula provides the basis of the passage from continuous p’
values to discrete ones and vice versa. Any problem can be Worked
out in terms of the discrete p' values, for Which the theory of §§ 59-61
can be used, and the results can be transformed back to refer to con-
tinuous p' values. The arbitrary density 8p? should then disappeaa‘
from the results.</p>
<p>The second formalism consists in modifying the equations of the
theory of §§ 59-61 so as to make them apply to the case of a con-
tinuous range of basic kets la’), by replacing sums by integrals and
replacing the 8 symbol in the commutation relations (11) by 8 func-
tions, so far as concerns the variables With continuous eigenvalues.
Each of these formalisms has some advantages and some disadvan-
tages. The first is usually more convenient for physical discussion,
the second for mathematical development. Both Will be developed
here and one or other will be used according to Which is more suitable
at the moment.</p>
<p>The Hamiltonian describing an assembly of photons interacting
With an atom will be of the general form (40), With the coefficients
H , Ua, Uab, VIZ, involving the atom variables. This Hamiltonian may</p>
<p>be Written H z HP+HQ+HR’ (53)</p>
<p>Where HP is the energy of the atom alone, HR is the energy of the
assembly of photons alone,</p>
<p>HR 5: 21 n91: hI/pr, 
P» I</p>
<p>‘up’ being the frequency of a photon of momentum p', and HQ is the
interaction energy, Which can be evaluated from analogy With the
classical theory, as Will be shown in the next section. The Whole
system can be treated by a perturbation method as discussed in the</p>
<p>§62 APPLICATION TO PHOTONS 237</p>
<p>preceding section, HP and HR providing the energy (41) of the
unperturbed system and HQ being the perturbation energy, which
gives rise t0 transition processes in which photons are emitted and
absorbed and the atom jumps from one stationary state to a-nother.</p>
<p>We saw in the preceding section that the probability of an absorp-
tion process is proportional to the number of bosons originally in the
state from which a boson is absorbed. From this We can infer that
the probability of a photon being absorbed from a beam of radiation
incident on an atom is proportional to the intensity of the beam.
We also saw that the probability of an emission process is propor-
tional to the number of bosons originally in the state concerned plus
one. To interpret this result we must make a careful study of the
relations involved in replacing the continuous range of photon states
by a discrete set.,</p>
<p>Let us neglect for the present the polarization variable 1. Let
|p’D&gt; be the normalized ket corresponding to the discrete photon
state p‘. Then from (22) of § l6</p>

<p>With n} photons in each discrete photon state p‘, the Gibbs

of § 33. From (57) this equals</p>

<p>X’) r1339’</p>
<p>if one puts in the value of the transformation function (X' 1p’) given
by (54) of § 23. Equation (58) expresses the number of photons per
unit volume as an integral over the momentum space, so the inte-
grand in (58) can be interpreted as the number of photons per unit
of phase space. We obtain in this way the result that the number of
photons per unit of phase space is equal to h“ times the number of
photons per discrete state, in other Words, a cell of volume h3 in phase
space is equivalent to a discrete state. This result is a general one,
holding for any kind of particle. If the polarization variable of the
photons is not neglected, the result holds for each of the two indepen-
dent states of polarization.</p>
<p>The momentum of a photon of frequency v is of magnitude lav/c,
so the element of momentum space</p>
<p>dp, d191, Clpz = b30413 dvclw,</p>
<p>do being an element of solid angle for the direction of the vector p.
Thus a distribution of photons with n}, per discrete state, which is
equivalent to a distribution of 72.43711, d3pd3x photons in an element
of volume dart: and an element of momentum space d3 , equals a
distribution of n; c"3v2rlvdwd3rrs photons in an element of volume d3x
and a frequency range dv ana direction of motion do. This corre-
sponds to an energy density n; 7ac"3v3 per unit solid angle per unit
frequency range, or an intensity per unit frequency range (i.e. an
energy crossing unit area per unit time per unit frequency range) of</p>
<p>I” i  hpglcz- </p>
<p>The result that the probability of a photon being emitted is pro-
portional to ngl-I-l, 12;, being the number of photons initially present
in the discrete state concerned, can now be interpreted as the proba-
bility being proportional to IvI+ltv3/62, where Iv, is the intensity of
the incident radiation per unit frequency range in the neighbourhood
of the frequency of the emitted photon and having the same polariza-
tion l as the emitted photon. Thus with no incident radiation there
is still a certain amount of emission, but the emission is increased or</p>
<p>§62 APPLICATION TO PHOTONS 239</p>
<p>stimulated by incident radiation in the same direction and having the
same frequency and polarization as the emitted radiation. The
present theory of radiation thus completes the imperfect one of § 45
by giving both stimulated and spontaneous emission. The ratio it
gives for the two kinds of emission, namely I,,: hﬁ/cg, is in agreement
with that provided by Einstein's theory of statistical equilibrium
mentioned in § 45.</p>
<p>The probability of a photon being scattered from the state p'l' to
the state p”l" is proportional to np»1,(np»1»+1), the n's being the
numbers of photons initially in the discrete states concerned. We can
interpret this result as the probability being proportional to</p>
<p>1,,,.(I,.,.'+h1/'B/@2). (60)
Similarly for a more general radiative process in which several
photons are ‘emitted and absorbed, the probability is proportional
to a factor 1,1 for each absorbed photon and a factor I,,1-|—hv3/c2 for
each emitted photon. Thus the process is stimulated by incident
radiation in the same direction and with the same frequency and
polarization as any of the emitted photons.</p>
<ol>
<li>The interaction energy between photons and an atom</li>
</ol>
<p>We shall now determine the interaction energy between an atom
and an assembly of photons, i.e. the HQ of equation (53), from
analogy with the classical expression for the interaction energy
between an atom and a field of radiation. For simplicity we shall
suppose the atom to consist of a single electron moving in an electro-
static field of force. The field of radiation may be described by a
scalar and a vector potential. These potentials are to a certain extent
arbitrary and may be chosen so that the scalar potential vanishes.
The field is then completely described by the vector potential A,, A,,
A,, or A. The change that the field. causes in the Hamiltonian
describing the atom is now, as explained at the beginning of § 41,</p>
<p>H = él-{(P+§A)2“p2} = ilémmqh</p>
<p>m</p>
<p>e2 A” (s1)</p>
<p>2mc2 '</p>
<p>This is the classical interaction energy. The A that occurs here should
be the value of the vector potential at the point where the electron is
momentarily situated. It is, however, a good enough approximation
if we take this A to be the vector potential at some fixed point in the
atom, such as the nucleus, provided we are dealing with radiation
whose wavelength is large compared with the dimensions of the atom.</p>
<p>24o THEORY OF RADIAJTION gas</p>
<p>Let us first consider the ﬁeld of radiation classically and ignare its
interaction with the atom. The vector potential A satisﬁes, according
to Maxwell's theory, the equations</p>
<p>DA: 0, divA=0, (62)</p>
<p>III being short for 82/02 69-»82/8m2--82/8y2~—82/3z2. The ﬁrst of these</p>
<p>equations shows that A can be resolved into Fourier coinponents in
the form</p>
<p>A I I {AR e—-'i(kx)+21r2'vk1 +31‘ eimxy-ewivkr} disk (63)</p>
<p>each Fourier coinponent representing a train of waves Inoving with
the velocity of light, described by a vector k whose direction gives</p>
<p>the direction of motion of the waves and whose magnitude [k] is
connected with their frequency 11k by</p>
<p>211v!‘ = CIR]. (64)</p>
<p>The vector k is just the momentum of a photon which the quantum
theory would associate with these waves, divided by f2. For each
value of k we have an amplitude A,, which is in general a complex
vector, and the integral in (63) extends over the whole of the three-
dimensional k-space. The second of equations (62) gives .</p>
<p>(k, A,,) = 0, (65)
showing that, for each value of k, A, is perpendicular t0 k. This
expresses that the waves are transverse waves. A, 1s determined by</p>
<p>its two components in two directions perpendicular to each other and</p>
<p>to k, these two components corresponding to two independent states
of linear polarization.</p>
<p>The total energy of the radiation is given by the volume integral</p>
<p>HR i: (em-l f (e2+#2)d3e (e6)</p>

<p>Using standard formulas of vector analysis, we have
div[AXJ#] = (&amp;, curlA)--(A,curl.#) = ﬂl- (A,curlcurlA)

with the help of the second of equations (62). Thus (66) becomes,</p>

<p>By substituting for A here its value given by (63), We can get the
energy of the radiation in terms of the Fourier amplitudes A,. The
energy of the radiation is constant (since We are now ignoring the
interaction of the radiation and the atom), so in this calculation We
may take t = 0. This means taking</p>

<p>The ﬁeld quantities é‘ and if at any point x can be looked upon

<p>are then dynamical variables at time t, since they are connected with
é‘ and f?‘ at various points x at time t by equations which do not
involve t, as follows from (63)and (67). A,, is constant, so AW varies
with t according to the simple harmonic law. Thus A,,, is Like the n;
of a harmonic oscillator, deﬁned by (3) of § 34, the w of the oscillator
being 2¢rvk. We may take each AW to be proportional to the "q, of
some harmonic oscillator and then the ﬁeld of radiation becomes a
set of harmonic oscillators.</p>
<p>Let us now pass over to the quantum theory and take the A,,,, Hm,
to be dynamical variables in the Heisenberg picture. The expression
(72) for the energy may be retained unchanged, the order in which
the factors A,,, 21k, there occur being the correct one to give no zero-
point energy. The A,,, then still vary with time according to the eiw‘
law and may still be taken to be proportional to the nfs of harmonic
oscillators. The factor of proportionality may be obtained by equat-
ing (72)to the expression (39) for the energy, with the label a replaced
by the two labels k and 1 and with hvk for ﬁwa. This gives</p>

<p>the sufﬁx t being inserted to show that we are dealing with Heisenberg

<p>4WZA klt x Chivilﬁklt Sin (73)</p>
<p>with neglect of an unimportant arbitrary phase factor. In this way
the Heisenberg dynamical variables 17w, which describe the ﬁeld of
radiation as a set of oscillators, are introduced. The commutation</p>
<p>relations between the 17m, and vim, are known, being given by (11), so
equation (73) ﬁxes the commutation relations between the A,,, and</p>
<p>Amt. It thus ﬁxes the commutation relations between the potentials
A and the ﬁeld quantities é‘ and i?‘ at various points X at the time t.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, the commutation relations of the A,,, Am are ﬁxed,</p>
<p>§63 INTERACTION ENERGY BETWEEN PHOTONS AND AN ATOM 243</p>
<p>so the commutation relation of two potential or ﬁeld quantities at
two different times is also ﬁxed.)</p>
<p>We can still use (73) when the interaction between the ﬁeld of
radiation and the atom is taken into account. This involves assuming
that the interaction does not affect the commutation relations
between the potentials and ﬁeld quantities at a given time. The
interaction causes the qklfs to cease to vary according to the simple
harmonic law and the oscillators to cease to be harmonic. Thus it
may affectthe commutation relation between two potential or ﬁeld
quantities at two different times.</p>
<p>We can now take over the interaction energy (6l)into the quantum
theory, putting p, for p to show it is a Heisenberg dynamical variable.
Taking the atomic nucleus to be at the origin we get, by substituting

<p>246 THEORY OF RADIATION §64</p>
<p>(f §45, in which the radiation ﬁeld is treated as an external perturba-
tion, gives the correct value for the absorption coeﬁicient.</p>
<p>This agreement between the elementary theory and the present
theory could be inferred from general arguments. The two theories
differ only in that the ﬁeld quantities all commute with one another
in the elementary theory and satisfy definite commutation relations
in the present theory, and this difference becomes unimportant for
strong ﬁelds. Thus the two theories must give the same absorption
and emission when strong fields are concerned. Since both theories
give the rate of absorption proportional to the intensity of the inci-
dent beam, the agreement must hold also for weak ﬁelds in the case of
absorption. In the same way the stimulated part of the emission in the
present theory must agree with the emissionin the elementary theory.</p>
<p>Let us now consider scattering. The direct scattering coefﬁcient is
given by formula (38) of $50. Such scattering of photons will not be
accompanied by any change of state of the atom on account of the
factor 3a,,» in the expression for the matrix element (77). Thus the
ﬁnal energy W‘ of the photon will equal its initial energy W”. The
scattering coefﬁcient now reduces to</p>
<p>e“/m9c4 .. (P10)?</p>
<p>This is the same as that given by classical mechanics for the scattering
of radiation by a free electron. We thus see that the direct scatter-
ing of radiation by an electron in an atom is independent of the atom
and is correctly given by the classical theory. This result, it should
be remembered, holds only provided the wavelength of the radiation
is large compared with the dimensions of the atom.</p>
<p>The direct scattering is a mathematical concept and cannot be
separated out experimentally from the total scattering, given by
formula (44) of§ 51. Let us see what this total scattering is in the
case of photons. We must be careful in our application of formula
(44) of § 51. The .summation g in this formula may be considered as</p>
<p>representing the contribution to the scattering of double transitions
consisting of transitions ﬁrstly from the initial state to state k and
secondly from state k to the ﬁnal state. The ﬁrst transition may be
an absorption of the incident photon and the second an emission of
the required scattered photon, but it is also possible for the first
transition to be the emission and the second the absorption. It is
clear from the general nature of the method used for deriving formula</p>
<p>§64 EMISSION, ABSORPTION, AND SCATTERING OF RADIATION 247</p>
<p>(44) of § 51 that both these kinds of double transitions must be in-
cluded in the summation Z when this formula is applied t0 photons,
k</p>
<p>although only the ﬁrst of them appears in the actual derivation given
in § 51, as the possibility of the particle being created or annihilated</p>
<p>was not taken into account there.</p>
<p>We use zero, single prime, and double prime to refer to the initial,
ﬁnal, and intermediate states of the atom respectively, and zero and
single prime to refer to the absorbed and emitted photons respec-
tively. Then, for the double transition of absorption followed by
emission, we must take for the matrix elements</p>

<li>An assembly offermions
An assembly of fermions can be treated by a method similar to
that used in §§ 59 and 60’ for bosons. With the laets (1 ) we may use
the antisymmetrizing operator A defined by
A=u’!—iZiP» (9')
summed over all permutations P, the + or — sign being taken
according to whether P is even or odd. Applied to the ket (I )it gives</li>
</ol>
<p>20'1"!’ 2 iplozfozg o¢§...o¢%.&gt; = A|o¢“o¢bcx°...cx9&gt;, (3')
a ket corresponding to a state for an assembly of u’ fermions. The</p>
<p>§65 AN ASSEMBLY OF FERMIONS 249</p>
<p>ket (3') is normalized provided the individual fermion kets {ma}, fab)...
are all different, otherwise it is zero. In this respect the ket (3') is
simpler than the ket (3). However, (3') is more complicated than (3)
in that (3') depends on the order in which a“, 00", 0",... occur in it,
being subject to a change of sign if an odd permutation is applied
to this order.</p>
<p>We can, as before, introduce the numbers n,, n2, n3,... of fermions
in the states a“), 0J2), 063),... and treat them as dynamical variables or
observables. They each have as eigenvalues only 0 and l. They form
a complete set of commuting observables for the assembly offermions.
The basic kets of a representation with the 927s diagonal may be taken
to be connected with the kets (3') by the equation</p>
<p>Afozacxboccmoag) =   (6')
corresponding to (6), the n”s being connected with the variables
00“, ab, 0f... by equation (4). The j; sign is needed in (6') since, for
given n”s, the occupied states a“, 0E’, 0",... are fixed but not their
order, so that the sign of the left-hand side of (6') is not fixed. To
set up a rule which determmes the sign in (6'), we must arrange all
the states 0¢ for a fermion arbitrarily in some standard order. The
06s occurring in the left-hand side of (6') form a certain selection from
all the 08s and the standard order for all the 06s will give a standard
order for this selection. We now make the rule that the + sign should
occur in (6') if the 08s on the left-hand side can be brought into their
standard order by an even permutation and the — sign if an odd
permutation is required. Owing to the complexity of this rule,
the representation with the basic kets In; né  is not a very
useful one.</p>
<p>If the number of fermions in the assembly is variable, we can set
up the complete set of kets</p>
<p>I), 10¢“), Ahxaa"), Ahxacxbuc), ..., (9')
corresponding to (9). A general ket is now expressible as a sum of
the various kets (9').</p>
<p>To continue with the development we introduce a set of linear
operators 17, ﬁ, one pair 17a, 6a corresponding to each fermion state cia,
satisfying the commutation relations</p>
<p>"70 W0+Wb “l0 = 0:
ﬁa- ﬁb+ﬁb Tia z 01 (11!)
"70 "?0+"?b 570 = 500-</p>
<p>250 THEORY OF RADIATION §65</p>
<p>These relations are like (11) with a + sign instead of a — on the left-
hand side. They show that, for a # b, 17a and ﬁg anticommute with
m, and 5b, while, putting b x a, they give</p>
<p>'03 == 0, 173m 0, ﬁana+7laﬁa = 1- (11")
To verify that the relations ( 11 ') are consistent, we note that linear
operators 1;, 1'3‘ satisfying the conditions (11') can be constructed in
the following “ray. For each state ca“ we take a set of linear operators
am, aya, am like the om, a”, 0,, introduced in § 37 to describe the spin
of an electron and such that am, 0W, am commute with a, ow, 6gb
for b 75 a. We also take an independent set of linear operators Q3,
one for each state 0:“, which all anticommute with one another and
have their squares unity, and commute with all the o variables.
Then, putting</p>
<p>a z %§a(Ua-a_“iUya)&gt; 77a. z %ga(axa+iaya)a
we have all tbe conditions (11') satisfied.
From (11")</p>

This is an algebraic equation for 17a ﬁa, showing that 17a i], is an
observable with the eigenvalues 0 and 1. Also 11,, ﬁa commutes with
m, {y}, for b 75 a. These results allow us to put</p>

taneous eigenlret of all the n's, belonging to the eigenvalues unity

<p>both sides being antisymmetrical in the labels a, 6, c,..., g. We have
here the analogue of (17).</p>
<p>If we pass over to a different set of basic kets {BA} for a fermion,
we can introduce a new set of linear operators 17A corresponding to
them. We then ﬁnd, by the same argument as in the case of bosons,
that the new 1fS are connected with the original ones by (21). This
shows that there is a procedure of second quantization for fermions,
similar to that for bosons, with the only difference that the commu-
tation relations (1 1') must be employed for fermions to replace the
commutation relations (11) for bosons.</p>
<p>A symmetrical linear operator UT of the form (22) can be expressed
in terms of the v7, 1‘; variables by a similar method to that used for
bosons. Equation (24) still holds, and so does (2 5) "with S replaced

<p>be expressed as  T: gdqza nlxablmcﬁbﬁti 5c, (35,)

<p>The foregoing jwork shows that there is a deep-seated analogy
between the theory of fermions and that of bosons, only slight
changes having to be made in the general equations of the formalism</p>
<p>when one TJELSSBS from one to the other.
There is, however, a development of the theory of fermions that</p>
<p>has no analogue for bosons. For fermions there are only the two</p>
<p>252 THEORY OF RADIATION §65</p>
<p>alternatives of a state being occupied or unoccupied and there is
symmetry between these two alternatives. One can demonstrate the
symmetry mathematically by making a transformation which inter-</p>
