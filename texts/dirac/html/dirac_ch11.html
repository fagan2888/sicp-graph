      <h1>RELATIVISTIC THEORY OF THE ELECTRON</h1>
<h1>66. Relativistic treatment 0f a particle</h1>
<p>THE theory we have been building up so far is essentially a non-
relativistic one. We have been working all the time with one par-
ticular Lorentz frame of reference and have set up the theory as an
analogue of the classical non-relativistic dynamics. Let us now try
to make the theory invariant under Lorentz transformations, so that
it conforms to the special principle of relativity. This is necessary in
order that the theory may apply to high-speed particles. There is no
need to make the theory conform to general relativity, since general
relativity is required only when one is dealing with gravitation, and
gravitational forces are quite unimportant in atomic phenomena.</p>
<p>Let us see how the basic ideas of quantum theory can be adapted
to the relativistic point of view that the four dimensions of space-
time should be treated on the same footing. The general principle
of superposition of states, as given in Chapter I, is a relativistic
principle, since it applies to ‘states’ with the relativistic space-time
meaning. However, the general concept of an observable does not ﬁt
in, since an observable may involve physical things at widely separated
points at one instant of time. In consequence, if one works with a
general representation referring to any complete set of commuting
observables, the theory cannot display the symmetry between space
and time required by relativity. In relativistic quantum mechanics
one must be content with having one representation which displays
this symmetry. One then has the freedom to transform to another
representation referring to a special Lorentz frame of reference if it
is useful for a particular calculation.</p>
<p>For the problem of a single particle, in order to display the syn).-
metry between space and time we must use the Schrodinger repre-
sentation. Let us put x1, x2, x3 for X, y, z, and x0 for ct. The time-
dependent wave function then appears as 914x20 x1x2X,) and provides
us with a basis for treating the four X's on the same footing.</p>
<p>We shall use relativistic notation, writing the four X's as x”
(u = 0, l, 2, 3). Any space-time vector with four components which
transform under Lorentz transformations like the four elements d411,,
will be written like a, with a lower Greek suffiX. We may raise the</p>
<p>254 RELATIVISTIC THEORY OF THE ELECTRON §66</p>
<p>suffix according to the rules
q," Z. a0, a} = -—a1, a2 z —a2, a3 == —_}a3. (1)</p>
<p>The a, are called the contravariant components of the vector a, and
the a,“ the covariant components. Two vectors a}, and b}, have a
Lorentz-invariant scalar product</p>
<p>Cl, b0—6151 b1-—CD2b2~—-(Z3b3 i  i ﬁlpbl‘,
a summation being implied over a repeated letter suffix. The funda-</p>
<p>mental tensor gP” is deﬁned by</p>
<p>} &lt;2)
QP""=O fOfp-#V.
With its help the rules (1)connecting covariant and contravariant
components may be written
a" = gPwav.</p>
<p>In the Schrodinger representation the momentum, whose com-
ponents will now be written p1, p2, p3 instead of Pm, p” P» i3 equal
to the operator</p>
<p>p, = "iﬁéi/Sx, (r= 1, 2,3). (3)
Now the four operators 61/62:}, form the covariant components of a
4-vector whose contravariant components are written ﬁ/ﬁxl“. So to
bring (3) into a relativistic theory, we must first write it with its</p>
<p>suffixes balanced, p, z m 8/53?’</p>
<p>and then extend it to the complete 4-vector equation
p’, 1 "Hi ﬁ/ﬁzzsl“. (4)</p>
<p>We thus have to introduce a new dynamical variable p0, equal to
the operator 11% 3/8x0. Since it forms a 4-vector when combined with the
momenta 19,, it must have the physical meaning of the energy of the
particle divided by c. We can proceed to develop the theory treating
the four p's on the same footing, like the four afs.</p>
<p>In the theory of the electron that will be developed here we shall
have to introduce a further degree of freedom describing an internal
motion of the electron. The wave function will thus have to involve
a further variable besides the four X'S.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Wave equation for the electron</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us consider first the case of the motion of an electron in the
absence of an electromagnetic field, so that the problem is simply</p>
<p>§57 THE WAVE EQUATION FOR THE ELECTRON 255</p>
<p>that of the free particle, as dealt with in §30, with the possible
addition of internal degrees of freedom. The relativistic Hamiltonian
provided by classical mechanics for this system is given by equation
(23)of § 30, and leads to the wave equation</p>
<p>{P0—(m2c2+2v%+2@%+2»%)*}¢ = 0, (5)
where the p's are interpreted as operators in accordance with
(4). Equation (5), although it takes into account the relation between
energy and momentum required by relativity, is yet unsatisfactory
from the point of view of relativistic theory, because it is very un-
symmetrical between p0 and the otherp's, so much so that one cannot
generalize it in a relativistic way to the case when, there is a ﬁeld</p>
<p>present. We must therefore look for a new wave equation.
If we multiply the wave equation (5) on the left by the operator</p>
<p>{pﬁ-(mgca-i-pflrpg +19%}, we obtain the equation</p>
<p>{P3-~m2@”-—2Y&gt;%—-21&gt;%~z&gt;§}¢ = 0, (6)
which is of a relativistically invariant form and may therefore more
conveniently be taken as the basis of a relativistic theory. Equation
(6)is not completely equivalent to equation (5) since, although every
solution of (5 )is also a solution of (6), the converse is not true. Only
those solutions of (6) belonging to positive values forpo are also
solutions of (5).</p>
<p>The wave equation (6) is not of the form required by the general
laws of the quantum theory on account of its being quadratic in p0.
In §27 we deduced from quite general arguments that the wave
equation must be linear in the operator 6/61? or p,, like equation (7)
of that section. We therefore seek a wave equation that is linear
in p0 and that is roughly equivalent to (6). In order that this wave
equation shall transform in a simple way under a Lorentz transforma-
tion, we try to arrange that it shall be rational and linear in p,, p2,
and p3 as vtell as in p,, and thuswf the form</p>
<p>{Po'"“"1¢1P1*O‘2P2'-'%Pa““ﬁ}¢ = 0, (7)</p>
<p>where the 03s and B are independent of the p's. Since we are consider-
ing the case of no field, all points in space-time must be equivalent,
so that the operator in the wave equation must not involve the X's.
Thus the a's and B must also be independent of the X's, so that they
must commute with the p's and the X's. They therefore describe
some new degree of freedom, belonging to some internal motion in</p>
<p>20s RELATIVISTIC THEORY OF THE ELECTRON §6T</p>
<p>the electron. We shall see later that they bring in the spin of the
electron.</p>
<p>Multiplying (7)by the operator {p0—|—0:1p1+02p2+0¢3p3+ﬁ?} on the
left, we obtain</p>
<p>{Pii““%[°‘iPi+(°¢1 @2+°‘2 @1)P1P2+(@1l8+18°‘1)291]“l32i¢ z 0»</p>
<p>where 2 refers to cyclic permutations of the suffixes 1,- 2, 3. This is
123</p>
<p>the same as (6) if the 08s and )8 satisfy the relations
00% = 1, cxlocg-I-onaml T: 0,
1B2 I 777/252» 051 B-kﬂal I O» _
together with the relations obtained from these by permuting the
suffixes 1, 2, 3. If we write
)8 = 00m ma,
these relations may be summed up in the single one,
swab-gab 04a = 28Gb (a,b = 1, 2, 3, or m). (8)
The four a's all anticommute with one another and the square of
each is unity.</p>
<p>Thus by giving suitable properties to the 08s and B we can make
the wave equation (7) equivalent to (6), in so far as the motion of
the electron as a whole is concerned. We may now assume (7)is the
correct relativistic wave equation for the motion of an electron in
the absence of a field. This gives rise to one difficulty, however,
owing to the fact that (7), like (6), is not exactly equivalent to (5),
but allows solutions corresponding to negative as well as positive
values of p,. The former do not, of course, correspond to any actually
observable motion of an electron. For the present we shall consider
only the positive-energy solutions and shall leave the discussion of
the negative-energy ones to $73.</p>
<p>We can easily obtain a representation of the four a's. They lmve
similar algebraic properties to the 0’s introduced in §37, which o’s
can be represented by matrices xxrith two rows and columns. So long
as we keep to matrices with two rows and columns we cannot get a
representation of more than three anticommuting quantities, and we
have to go to four rows and columns to get a representation of the
four antiieommuting 08s. It is convenient first to express the a's in
terms of the 09s and also of a second similar set of three anticom-
muting variables whose squares are unity, p1, p2, p3 say, that are</p>
<p>§67 THE WAVE EQUATION FOR THE ELECTRON 257</p>
<p>independent of and commute with the u's. We may take, amongst
other possibilities,</p>
<p>‘<em>1 Z P161» ‘</em>2 i P1U2&gt; ‘*3 z P1 Us» “m z Pa» (9)
and the a's will then satisfy all the relations (8), as may easily be</p>
<p>verified. If we now take a representation with p3 and 0'3 diagonal,
we shall get the following scheme of matrices:</p>
<p>0'1 r: O 1 O O 0'2 1<em>: O </em>2: O O 0'3 = 1 O 0 O
1 O O O i O O O O —-1 0 O
0 0 0 1 O 0 0 —:i O O 1 O
0 0 1 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 0 -

1 0 0 0 i O 0 0 0 0 --1 0
0 ' 1 0 O 0 i 0 0 0 O 0 -—1 .
I t should be noted that the p’s and a's are all Hermitian, which makes</p>
<p>the 08s also Hermitian.</p>
<p>Corresponding to the four rows and columns, the wave function 1/1
must contain a variable that takes on four values, in order that the
matrices shall be capable of being multiplied into it. Alternatively,
we may look upon the wave function as having four components, each
a function only of the four afs. We saw in § 37 that the spin of the
electron requires the wave function to have two components. The
fact that our present theory gives four is due to our wave equation
(7) having twice as many solutions as it ought» to have, half of them
corresponding to states of negative energy.</p>
<p>With the help of (9), the wave equation (7) may be written with
three-dimensional vector notation</p>
<p>{Pix-Palm P)"Psm5i¢ I 9- (W)
To generalize this equation to the case when there is an electro-
magnetic field present, we follow the classical rule of replacing p0 and
p by po-l-e/c .A , and P-l-é/(LA, A , and A being the scalar and vector
potentials of the field at the place where the electron is. This gives
us the equation</p>
<p>{p0i+'f;A0H_-p1(c:  T": 0s </p>
<p>which is the fundamental wave equation of the relativistic theory of
the electron.</p>
<p>258 RELATIVISTIC THEORY OF THE ELECTRON §67</p>
<p>The four components Ofgb in (10)or (l1)should be pictured as Written
one below another, so as to form a single-column matrix. The square
matrices p and 0' then get multiplied into the single-column matrix 1p
according to matrix multiplication, the product being in each case
another single-column matrix. The conjugate imaginary Wave func-
tion that represents a bra should be pictured as having its four com-
ponents Written one beside another, so as to form a single-row matrix,
which can be multiplied from the right by a square matrix p or 0' to give
another single-row matrix. We denote this conjugate imaginary Wave
function pictured as a single-row matrix by f‘, using the symbol l to
denote the transpose of any matrix, i.e. the result of interchanging
the rows and columns, Then the conjugate imaginary ofequation (ll)</p>

tion operating to the left must be interpreted according to (24)of $22.</p>
<ol>
<li>Invariance under a Lorentz transformation</li>
</ol>
<p>Before proceeding to discuss the physical consequences of the Wave
equation (ll) or (12), We shall first verify that our theory really is
invariant under a Lorentz transformation, or, stated more accurately,
that the physical results the theory leads to are independent of the
Lorentz frame of reference used. This is not by any means obvious
from the form of the Wave equation (ll). We have to verify that, if
We Write down the Wave equation in a different Lorentz frame, the
solutions of the new Wave equation may be put into one-one corre-
spondence "smith those of the original one in such a Way that corre-
sponding solutions may be assumed to represent the same state. For
either Lorentz frame, the square of the modulus of the Wave function,
summed over the four components, should give the probability per
unit volume of the electron being at a certain place in that Lorentz
frame. We may call this the probability density. Its values, calculated
in different Lorentz frames for Wave functions representing the same
state, should be connected like the time components in these franles</p>
<p>.of some 4-vector. Further, the 4-dimensional divergence of this 4-</p>
<p>vector should vanish, signifying conservation of the electron, or that
the electron cannot appear or disappear in any volume Without passing
through the boundary.</p>
<p>§68 INVARIANCE UNDER A LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION 259</p>
<p>For brevity it is convenient t0 introduce the symbol a, = I and to</p>
<p>suppose that the suffixes of the four up (a x 0, 1, 2, 3) can be raised
in accordance With the rules (l), even though these four 08s do not
form the components of a 4-vector. We can now Write the Wave</p>
<p>equation (11) {aib(pp+efﬁ_A}L)<em>Oﬁ)nq'n6}¢ = ()</em> (13)
The four at‘ satisfy</p>
<p>oapcxnlcxv-l-cxvcxhuorl“ = ggPvocnl (l4)
with g1“ defined by (2), as one can verify by taking separately the cases
when u and v are both O, when one of them is 0, and When neither of</p>
<p>them is 0.
Let us apply an infinitesimal Lorentz transformation and distinguish</p>
<p>quantities referring to the new frame of reference by a star. The com-
ponents of the 4-vector p” will transform according to equations of</p>
<p>m“ W1” Pi = P,,.+@,£’P.,, (15)</p>
<p>Where the a" are small numbers of the first order. We shall neglect
quantities that are quadratic in the a's and thus of the second order.
The condition for a Lorentz transformation is that
PM?” = 2am”,</p>
<p>which gives “pvﬁvf-w-l-Pa a” v = 9,</p>
<p>leading to aI-W-l-WP = 0. (16)
The components of A,, will transform according to the same law, so</p>
<p>We have
pp-l-EB/(LAJL = p:+€/6.A:——a;,_”(pf+€/CJ13‘).</p>
<p>Thus the Wave equation (13) becomes

with the help of (l6), and hence
cxP"(I—|-o¢mM) = (l+Mam)(a~-ap»ap). (19)
Thus, multiplying (I 7) by (l-I-Mcxm) on the left, We get

<p>This is of the same fornl as (l 3)with the starred variables pi, AZ, W“,
and shows that (l 3)is invariant under an inﬁnitesimal Lorentz trans-
formation, provided 55 is subjected to the right transformation, given
by (20). A ﬁnite Lorentz transformation can be built up from infinite-
simal ones, so under a finite Lorentz transformation the wave equation
(13) is also invariant. Note that the matrices w“ do not get altered at all.</p>
<p>The invariance proved above means that the solutions 5b of the
original wave equation (l3) are in one-one correspondence with the
solutions 1/1"‘ of the new wave equation (21), corresponding solutions
being connected by (20). We assume that corresponding solutions
represent the same physical state. We must now verify that the
physical interpretations of corresponding solutions, referred to their
respective Lorentz frames of reference, are in agreement. This requires
that ﬁll/J should give the probability density referred to the original
frame and 1,5<em>l¢</em> the probability density referred to the new frame.
Let us examine the relationship between these quantities. $50 is the
same as gZlaOQB and forms one of the four quantities illlowgb, which should
be treated together.</p>
<p>Equations (l 8)and (l 6)show that M is pure imaginary. Thus the
conjugate imaginary of equation (20) is</p>

<p>with the help of (l 6). If we lower the suffix p. here, we get an equation
of the same form as (l5), which shows that the four quantities gblaptﬁ
transform like the contravariant components of a é-vector. Thus JJ-lgb
transforms like the time component of a 4-vector, which is the correct
transformation law for a probability density. The space components
of the 4-vector, namely gbloc, 3b, if multiplied by c, give the probability</p>
<p>current, or the probability of the electron crossing unit area per
unit time.</p>
<p>Hence</p>

<ol>
<li>The motion 0f a free electron</li>
</ol>
<p>It is-of interest to consider the motion of a free electron in the
Heisenberg picture according to the above theory and to study the
Heisenberg equations of motion. These equations of motion can be
integrated exactly, as Was first done by Schrodingerxjj For brevity
We shall omit the suffix z‘ Which the notation of § 28 requires to be
inserted in dynamical variables that vary With time in the Heisen-</p>

As Hamiltonian We must take the expression Which We get as equal</p>
<p>to cpo When We put the operator on 1/1 in (1 0)equal to zero, i.e.</p>
<p>H = cP1(°'= P)+P3mc2 = CW: P)+P3mC2- 
We see at once that the momentum commutes with H and is thus a
constant of the motion. Further, the sat-component of the velocity is</p>
<p>3.71 = [$1, H] = 6%- 
This result is rather surprising, as it means an altogether different

<p>relation between velocity and momentum from what one has ill
classical mechanics. It is connected, however, with the expression
gﬁldocl all for a component of theprobability current. The .231 given by (24)
has as eigenvalues 31:0, corresponding to the eigenvalues i1 of a1.
As :82 and 253 are similar, we can conclude that a measurement of a com-
ponent 0f the velocity 0f a free electron is certain t0 leaa’ to the result 3136-
This conclusion is easily seen to hold also when there is a ﬁeld present.</p>
<p>Since electrons are observed in practice to have velocities con-
siderably less than that of light, it would seem that we have here a
contradiction with experiment. The contradiction is not real, though,
since the theoretical velocity in the above conclusion is the velocity
at one instant of time while observed velocities are always average
velocities through appreciable time intervals. We shall ﬁnd upon
further examination of the equations of motion that the velocity is
not at all constant, but oscillates rapidly about a mean value which
agrees with the observed value.</p>
<p>It may easily be veriﬁed that a measurement of a component of the
velocity must lead to the result is in a relativistic theory, simply
from an elementary application of the principle of uncertainty of
§ 24. To measure the velocity we must measure the position at two
slightly different times and then divide the change of position by the
time interval. (It will not do to measure the momentum and apply
a formula, as the ordinary connexion between velocity and momen-
tum is not validz) In order that our measured velocity may approxi-
mate to the instantaneous velocity, the time interval between the
two measurements of position must be very short and hence these
measurements must be very accurate. The great accuracy with
which the position of the electron is known during the time-interval
must give rise, according to the principle of uncertainty, to an almost
complete indeterminacy in its momentum. This means that almost
all values of the momentum are equally probable, so that the momen-
tum is almost certain to be infinite. An inﬁnite value for a component
of momentum corresponds to the value 31:0 for the corresponding
component of velocity.</p>
<p>Let us now examine how the velocity of the electron varies with</p>
<p>time. We have iﬁdl = a1 H__Ha1_</p>

<p>Since H and p1 are constants, it follows from the first of equsttions

of equations (25)leads in the same way to the result</p>

by the classical relativistic formula, and an oscillatory part
%,i6%d2 _8_2».-:r1z/nH_1,</p>
<p>whose frequency is high, being ZH/k, which is at least QmcB/ia. Only
the constant part would be observed in a practical measurement of

This equation differs from (30) through having two extra terms in

in (34) appearing without the pure imaginary part. For an electron
moving slowly (i.e. with small momentum), we may expect the
Heisenberg equations of motion to be determined by a Hamiltonian
of the form mc2+H1, where H1 is small compared with mcZ. Putting

<p>The spin angular momentum does not give rise to any potential
energy and therefore does not appear in the result of the preceding
calcillation. The simplest Way of showing the existence of the spin
angular momentum is to take the case of the motion ofa free electron
or an electron in a central ﬁeld of force and determine the angular
momentum integrals. This means Working with the Hamiltonian (23),

<p>The same vector c ﬁxes the directions of both the spin magnetic

<p>We were led to the value e572} for the spin of the electron by an
argument depending simply on general principles of quantum theory
and relativity. One could apply the same argument to other kinds
of elementary particle and one would be led to the same conclusion,
that the spin angular momentum is half a quantum. This woulcl be
satisfactory for the proton and the neutron, but there are some kinds
of elementary particle (eg. the photon and certain kinds of meson)
whose spins are known experimentally to be different from 5t, so we
have a discrepancy between our theory and experiment.</p>
<p>The answer is to be found in a hidden assumption in our work.
Our argument is valid only provided the position of the particle is
an observable. If this assumption holds, the particle must have a
spin angular momentum of half a quantum. For those particles that
have a different spin the assumption must be false and any dynamical
variables x1, x,, x3 that may be introduced to describe the position
of the particle cannot be observables in accordance with our general
theory. For such particles there is no true Schrodinger representation.
One might be able to introduce a quasi wave function involving the
dynamical variables x1, x,, x3, but it would not have the correct
physical interpretation of a wave function—that the square of its
modulus gives the probability density. For such particles there is still
a momentum representation, which is sufficient for practical purposes.</p>

<li>Transition to polar variables</li>
</ol>
<p>For the further study of the motion of an electron in a central field
of force with the Hamiltonian (38), it is convenient to make a
transformation to polar coordinates, as was done in §38 in the
non-relativistic case. We can introduce r and p, as before, but
instead of k, the magnitude of the orbital angular momentum m,
which is no longer a constant of the motion, we must now use the
magnitude of the total angular momentum M = 111+ ya. Let us put</p>
<p>3W = M§+Mg+zug+yza (39)</p>
<p>26s RELATIVISTIC THEORY OF THE ELECTRON §v1</p>
<p>The eigenvalues 0f m3 are integral multiples of ﬁ, those 0f $103 are
jjﬁ, and hence those of M3 must be half odd integral multiples of

be integers greater than zero.</p>

Hence {(0,n1)—|—%}2 = M2+§='-%2.
Thus (o,m)-I-?€ is a quantity whose square is Mil-iii? and we could,
consistently with equation (39), deﬁne jﬁ as (a, mH-ﬁ. This would
not be the most convenient deﬁnition for j, however, since we would</p>
<p>like to have j a constant of the motion and (a,m)+1'i is not constant.
We have, in fact, from applications of (32),</p>
<p>(0, m)(0, p) = 'i(0, m &gt;&lt; p)

or {(6, means, PH-(s, pm new} m o.
Thus (a,m)+?i anticommutes with one of the terms in the expression
(38)for H, namely the term Cpl(6, p), and commutes with the other
two. It follows that p3{(c:, mH-ﬁ} commutes with all the three terms
in H and is a constant of the motion. But the square of p3{(0', mH-fi}</p>
<p>is also Mg-l-liég. “W e can therefore take

which gives us a convenient rational definition for j which is consis-
tent with (39) and makes j a constant of the motiori. The eigenvalues
of this j are all positive and negative integers, excluding zero.</p>
<p>By a further application of (32), we get

the linear operator e defined by</p>

<p>§71 TRANSITION TO POLAR VARIABLES 269</p>
<p>Since r commutes with p1 and with (0,x),it must commute with E.
We thus have
rZeZ = [p1(€$, x)]2 == (a, X)2 = x2 = r2,</p>
<p>OI‘ e2 x1.</p>
<p>Now p1(G, p) commutes with j, and since there is symmetry between
x and p so far as angular momentum is concerned, p1(a, x) must also
commute withj. Hence e commutes withj. Further, e must commute
with p,, since we have</p>
<p>(6, XXX, PP-(X, PM“, X) == (@1414, P)-(X= PW) = iﬁﬁfhX),
which gives TeTpr-hTprTe == iﬁre,

Thus (38) becomes</p>

<p>This gives our Hamiltonian expressed in terms of polar variables. It
should be noticed that e and p3 commute with all the other variables
occurring in H and anticommute with one another. This means that
we can take a representation with p3 diagonal in which e and p3 are

<ol>
<li>Theory 0f the positron</li>
</ol>
<p>It has been mentioned in § 67 that the wave equation for the elec-
tron admits of twice as many solutions as it ought to, half of them
referring to states with negative values for the kinetic energy cpg-i-eAo.
This difficulty was introduced as soon as we passed from equation (5)
to equation (6) and is inherent in any relativistic theory. It occurs
also in classical relativistic theory, but is not then serious since, owing
to the continuity in the variation of all classical dynamical variables,
if the kinetic energy cpo-keAo is initially positive (when it must be
greater than or equal to mc2), it cannot subsequently be negative
(when it would have to be less than or equal to —mc2). In the
quantum theory, however, discontinuous transitions may take place,
so that if the electron is initially in a state of positive kinetic energy
it may make a transition to a state of negative kinetic energy. It is
therefore no longer permissible simply to ignore the negative-energy
states, as one can do in the classical theory.</p>
<p>Let us examine the negative-energy solutions of the equation</p>
<p>{(190+§A0)“°‘1(P1+§A1)*
,@¢2(p2-1€A2)—a3(p3+§A3)——cxmmc}¢ r- 0 (56)</p>
<p>a little more closely. For this purpose it is convenient to use a repre-
sentation of the a's in which all the elements of the matrices repre-
senting 4x1, a2, and (x3 are real and all those of the matrix representing</p>
<p>'\</p>
<p>274 RELATIVISTIC THEORY OF THE ELECTRON §73</p>
<p>a,, are pure imaginary or zero. Such a.representation may be obtained,
for instance, from that of § 67 by interchanging the expressions for a,
and a, in (If). If equation (56)is expressed as a matrix equation in
this representation and we put -1I for i all through it, we get, remem-
bering the i in (4),</p>
<p>l(""Po+ZAQ)_“O‘1(-*P1+SA1)"</p>
<p>i/a2(--]92+gA2)——oc3(~—P3—-|—§A3)+o¢mm6}$ I 0. (57)</p>
<p>Thus each solution 1b of the wave equation (56) has for its conjugate
complex if} a solution ofthe wave equation (57). Further, ifthe solution
1,6 of (56) belongs to a negative value for Cpo-l-QAO, the corresponding
solution i of (57) will belong to a positive value for cpO-ezlo. But the
operator in (57)is just what one would get if one substituted --e for e
in the operator in (56). It follows that each negative-energy solution
of (56)is the conjugate complex of a positive-energy solution of the
wave equation obtained from (56)by substitution of -—e for e, which
solution represents an electron of charge +e (instead of —e, as we
had up to the present) moving through the given electromagnetic ﬁeld.
Thus the unwanted solutions of (56) are connected with the motion
of an electron with a charge +e. (Itis not possible, of course, with
an arbitrary electromagnetic ﬁeld, to separate the solutions of (56)
definitely into those referringto positive andthose referring to negative
values for opO-l-eatélo, as such a separation would imply that transitions
from one kind to the other do not occur. The preceding discussion is
therefore only a rough one, applying to the case when such a separation
is approximately possible.)</p>
<p>In this way we are led to infer that the negative-energy solutions
of (56) refer to the motion of a new kind of particle having the mass
of an electron and the opposite charge. Such particles have been
observed experimentally and are called positrons. We cannot, how-
ever, simply assert that the negative-energy solutions represent posi-
trons, as this would make the dynamical relations all wrong. For
instance, it is certainly not true that a positron has a negative kinetic
energy. We must therefore establish the theory of the positrons on
a somewhat different footing. We assume that nearly all the negative-
energy states are occupied, with one electron in each state in accordance
with the exclusion principle of Pauli. An unoccupied negative-energy</p>
<p>§73 THEORY OF THE POSITRON 275</p>
<p>state will now appear as something with a positive energy, since to
make it disappear, i.e. t0 ﬁll it up, we should have t0 add t0 it an
electron with negative energy. We assume that these unoccupied
negative-energy states are the positrons.</p>
<p>These assumptions require there to be a distribution of electrons
of inﬁnite density everywhere in the world. A perfect vacuum is a
region where all the states of positive energy are unoccupied and all
those of negative energy are occupied. In a perfect vacuum Maxwell's</p>
<p>equation div é. = 0</p>
<p>must, of course, be valid. This means that the infinite distribution
of negative-energy electrons does not contribute to the electric ﬁeld.
Only departures from the distribution in a vacuum will contribute
to the electric density j‘) in Maxwell's equation</p>
<p>divé‘ = 4173",. (58)
Thus there will be a contribution —e for each occupied state of posi-
tive energy and a contribution +e for each unoccupied state of
negative energy.</p>
<p>The exclusion principle will operate to prevent a positive-energy
electron ordinarily from making transitions to states of negative
energy. It will still be possible, however, for such an electron to
drop into an unoccupied state of negative energy. In this case we
should have an electron and positron disappearing simultaneously,
their energy being emitted in the form of radiation. The converse
process would consist in the creation of an electron and a positron
from electromagnetic radiation.</p>
<p>From the symmetry between occupied and unoccupied fermion
states discussed at the end of § 66, the present theory is essentially
symmetrical between the electrons and the positrons. We should
have an equivalent theory if we supposed the positrons to be the
basic particles, described by wave equations of the form (11) with --e
for e, and then supposed that nearly all the states of negative energy
for the positrons are ﬁlled up, a hole in the distribution of negative~
energy positrons being then interpreted as an ordinary electron. The
theory could be developed consistently with the hypothesis that all
the laws of physics are symmetrical between positive and negative
