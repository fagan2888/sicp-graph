#62. Application to photons

Since photons are bosons, the foregoing theory can be applied to
them. A photon is in a stationary state when it is in an eigenstate
of momentum. It then has two independent states of polarization,
which may be taken to be two perpendicular states of linear polariza-
tion. The dynamical variables needed to describe the stationary
states are then the momentum p, a vector, and a polarization variable
1, consisting of a unit vector perpendicular to p. The variables p and
1 take the place of our previous ds. The eigenvalues of p consist of
all numbers from ~00 to o0 for each of the three Cartesian com-
ponents of p, while for each eigenvalue p' of p, 1 has just two
eigenvalues, namely’ two arbitrarily chosen vectors perpendicular
to p' and to one another. Owing to the eigenvalues of p forming
a continuous range, there are a continuous range of stationary
states, giving us the continuous basic kets ]p’l’). However, the fore-
going theory was built up in terms of discrete basic kets Ia’) for a
boson. There are two formalisms which one may use for getting over
this discrepancy.

23s THEORY 0F RADIATION §a2

The first consists in replacing the continuous three-dimensional
distribution of eigenvalues for p by a- large number of discrete points
lying very close together, forming a dust spread over the Whole three-
dimensional p-space. Let s, be the density of the dust (the number
of points per unit volume) in the neiglibourhood of any point p‘.
Then s9» must be large and positive, but is otherwise an arbitrary
function of p‘. An integral over the p-space may be replaced by a
sum over the dust of points, in accordance with the formula

f f f fun d1»; dPLdP; = 2f<p*)s;-1» <52)

Which formula provides the basis of the passage from continuous p’
values to discrete ones and vice versa. Any problem can be Worked
out in terms of the discrete p' values, for Which the theory of §§ 59-61
can be used, and the results can be transformed back to refer to con-
tinuous p' values. The arbitrary density 8p? should then disappeaa‘
from the results.

The second formalism consists in modifying the equations of the
theory of §§ 59-61 so as to make them apply to the case of a con-
tinuous range of basic kets la’), by replacing sums by integrals and
replacing the 8 symbol in the commutation relations (11) by 8 func-
tions, so far as concerns the variables With continuous eigenvalues.
Each of these formalisms has some advantages and some disadvan-
tages. The first is usually more convenient for physical discussion,
the second for mathematical development. Both Will be developed
here and one or other will be used according to Which is more suitable
at the moment.

The Hamiltonian describing an assembly of photons interacting
With an atom will be of the general form (40), With the coefficients
H , Ua, Uab, VIZ, involving the atom variables. This Hamiltonian may

be Written H z HP+HQ+HR’ (53)

Where HP is the energy of the atom alone, HR is the energy of the
assembly of photons alone,

HR 5: 21 n91: hI/pr, 
P» I

‘up’ being the frequency of a photon of momentum p', and HQ is the
interaction energy, Which can be evaluated from analogy With the
classical theory, as Will be shown in the next section. The Whole
system can be treated by a perturbation method as discussed in the

§62 APPLICATION TO PHOTONS 237

preceding section, HP and HR providing the energy (41) of the
unperturbed system and HQ being the perturbation energy, which
gives rise t0 transition processes in which photons are emitted and
absorbed and the atom jumps from one stationary state to a-nother.

We saw in the preceding section that the probability of an absorp-
tion process is proportional to the number of bosons originally in the
state from which a boson is absorbed. From this We can infer that
the probability of a photon being absorbed from a beam of radiation
incident on an atom is proportional to the intensity of the beam.
We also saw that the probability of an emission process is propor-
tional to the number of bosons originally in the state concerned plus
one. To interpret this result we must make a careful study of the
relations involved in replacing the continuous range of photon states
by a discrete set.,

Let us neglect for the present the polarization variable 1. Let
|p’D> be the normalized ket corresponding to the discrete photon
state p‘. Then from (22) of § l6

g IP’D><P'I>I == 1»
which gives from (52)

ket corresponding to the continuous state p’, we have according to

(24) Of§ 16 f lp’><1>’) d3?’ = 1,

which shows, on comparison with (55);that

The connexion between Ip’) and l p'D> is like the connexion between
the basic kets when one changes the weight function of the representa-
tion, as shown by ('38) of § l6.

With n} photons in each discrete photon state p‘, the Gibbs
density p for the assembly of photons is, according to (68) of § 33,

)5 = g |p'5>5;.<p'5| - f |p'5>5;)<p'5)5.» 555'

= f )p’>5;.)<p'r 53:5’ (55)

with the help of (56). The ntunber of photons per unit volume in the

23s THEORY OF RADIATION §62

neighbourhood of any point x’ is then (x’|p|x’>, according to (73)
of § 33. From (57) this equals

<>v|p Xv = f <X*1p*>r»;<p'

.-_- f 727312,}, e133)’ (53)

X’) r1339’

 

if one puts in the value of the transformation function (X' 1p’) given
by (54) of § 23. Equation (58) expresses the number of photons per
unit volume as an integral over the momentum space, so the inte-
grand in (58) can be interpreted as the number of photons per unit
of phase space. We obtain in this way the result that the number of
photons per unit of phase space is equal to h“ times the number of
photons per discrete state, in other Words, a cell of volume h3 in phase
space is equivalent to a discrete state. This result is a general one,
holding for any kind of particle. If the polarization variable of the
photons is not neglected, the result holds for each of the two indepen-
dent states of polarization.

The momentum of a photon of frequency v is of magnitude lav/c,
so the element of momentum space

dp, d191, Clpz = b30413 dvclw,

do being an element of solid angle for the direction of the vector p.
Thus a distribution of photons with n}, per discrete state, which is
equivalent to a distribution of 72.43711, d3pd3x photons in an element
of volume dart: and an element of momentum space d3 , equals a
distribution of n; c"3v2rlvdwd3rrs photons in an element of volume d3x
and a frequency range dv ana direction of motion do. This corre-
sponds to an energy density n; 7ac"3v3 per unit solid angle per unit
frequency range, or an intensity per unit frequency range (i.e. an
energy crossing unit area per unit time per unit frequency range) of

 I” i  hpglcz- 

The result that the probability of a photon being emitted is pro-
portional to ngl-I-l, 12;, being the number of photons initially present
in the discrete state concerned, can now be interpreted as the proba-
bility being proportional to IvI+ltv3/62, where Iv, is the intensity of
the incident radiation per unit frequency range in the neighbourhood
of the frequency of the emitted photon and having the same polariza-
tion l as the emitted photon. Thus with no incident radiation there
is still a certain amount of emission, but the emission is increased or

§62 APPLICATION TO PHOTONS 239

stimulated by incident radiation in the same direction and having the
same frequency and polarization as the emitted radiation. The
present theory of radiation thus completes the imperfect one of § 45
by giving both stimulated and spontaneous emission. The ratio it
gives for the two kinds of emission, namely I,,: hﬁ/cg, is in agreement
with that provided by Einstein's theory of statistical equilibrium
mentioned in § 45.

The probability of a photon being scattered from the state p'l' to
the state p”l" is proportional to np»1,(np»1»+1), the n's being the
numbers of photons initially in the discrete states concerned. We can
interpret this result as the probability being proportional to

1,,,.(I,.,.'+h1/'B/@2). (60)
Similarly for a more general radiative process in which several
photons are ‘emitted and absorbed, the probability is proportional
to a factor 1,1 for each absorbed photon and a factor I,,1-|—hv3/c2 for
each emitted photon. Thus the process is stimulated by incident
radiation in the same direction and with the same frequency and
polarization as any of the emitted photons.
