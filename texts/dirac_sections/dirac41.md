#41. The Zeeman effect for the hydrogen atom

We shall now consider the system of a hydrogen atom in a uniform
magnetic ﬁeld. The Harniltonian (5 7 )With V = —62/I',Wl1lCl1 describes
the hydrogen atom in no external ﬁeld, gets modiﬁed by the magnetic
ﬁeld, the modiﬁcation, according to classical mechanics, consisting
in the replacement of the components of momentum, pm, p”, pa, by
px-l-e/mAx, py+e/c.A,, pz-I-G/(LA, Where A,, A,, A, are the com-
ponents of the vector potential describing the ﬁeld. For a uniform
ﬁeld of magnitude A‘ in the direction of the x-axis We nlay take

A, = —%.#y, A, = évlaix, A, = 0. The classical Hamiltonian will
then be
_ 1 1 e 2 1 e 2 2 e2
H=%{( w""§zﬂ3i) d-(Py+§zﬂx) +Pz}"7-

This classical Hamiltonian may be taken over into the quantum
theory if We add on to it a term giving the effect of the spin of the
electron. According to experimental evidence and according to the
theory of Chapter XI , theelectron has a magnetic moment -—e?zZ/2*mc. a,
Where a is the spin vector of § 37. The energy of this magnetic moment
in the magnetic ﬁeld Will be eﬁﬁ/ 27110.02. Thus the total quantum

Harniltonian Will be

There ought strictly to be other terms in this Hamiltonian giving the
interaction of the magnetic moment of the electron With the electric
ﬁeld of the nucleus of the atom, but this effect is small, of the same
order of magnitude as the correction one gets by taking relativistic
mechanics into account, and Will be neglected here. It mill be taken
into account in the relativistic theory of the electron given in
Chapter XI.

If the magnetic ﬁeld is not too large, we can neglect terms involving
2, so that the Hamiltonian (88) reduces to

The extra terms due t0 the magnetic ﬁeld are now eﬂ/Qmc. (mz-l-ﬁaz).
But these extra terms commute with the total Hamiltonian and are
thus constants of the motion. This makes the problem very easy.
The stationary states of the system, i.e. the eigenstates of the Ha-mil-
tonian (89), will be those eigenstates of the Hamiltonian for no ﬁeld
that are simultaneously eigenstates of the observables m, and a,, or
at least of the one observable mz+%azs and the energy-levels of the
system will be those for the system with no ﬁeld, given by (80) if
one considers only closed states, increased by an eigenvalue of
eﬂ/QmcuQnzZ-l-haz). Thus stationary states of the system with no
ﬁeld for which m, has the numerical value mg, an integral multiple
of 11L, and for which also a, has the numerical value a; = i1, will still
be stationary states when the ﬁeld is applied. Their energy will be
increased by an amount consisting of the sum of two parts, a part
eﬂ/Qmcxm; arising from the orbital motion, which part may be con-
sidered as due to an orbital magnetic moment -—emf,/2ww, and a part
eﬂ/ 2772,0120; arising from the spin. The ratio of the orbital magnetic
moment to the orbital angular tcnomentum m; is --e/2mc, which is
half the ratio of the spin magnetic moment to the spin angular
momentum. This fact is sometimes referred to as the magnetic
anomaly of the spin.

Since the energy-levels now involve ma, the selection rule for m,
obtained in the preceding section becomes capable of direct com-
parison with experiment. We take a Heisenberg representation in
which, among other constants of the motion, m, and a, are diagonal.
The selection rule for m, now requires m, to change by 6, 0, or —6,
while a2, since it commutes with the electric displacement, will not
change at all. Thus the energy difference between the two states
taking part in the transition process will differ by an amount
eﬁﬂ/Zmc, 0, or “eﬁﬂ/Zmc from its value for no magnetic ﬁeld.
Hence, from Bohr's frequency condition, the frequency of the
associated electromagnetic radiation will differ by eﬂ/éwmc, 0, or
--—6ﬂ/41rm(3 from that for no magnetic ﬁeld. This means that each
spectral line for no magnetic ﬁeld gets split up by the ﬁeld into three
components. If one considers radiation moving in the z-direction,
then froln (83) the two outer components will be circularly polarized,
while the central undisplaced one will be of zero intensity. These
results are in agreement with experiment and also with the classical
theory of the Zeeman effect.
