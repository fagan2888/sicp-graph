#68. Invariance under a Lorentz transformation

Before proceeding to discuss the physical consequences of the Wave
equation (ll) or (12), We shall first verify that our theory really is
invariant under a Lorentz transformation, or, stated more accurately,
that the physical results the theory leads to are independent of the
Lorentz frame of reference used. This is not by any means obvious
from the form of the Wave equation (ll). We have to verify that, if
We Write down the Wave equation in a different Lorentz frame, the
solutions of the new Wave equation may be put into one-one corre-
spondence "smith those of the original one in such a Way that corre-
sponding solutions may be assumed to represent the same state. For
either Lorentz frame, the square of the modulus of the Wave function,
summed over the four components, should give the probability per
unit volume of the electron being at a certain place in that Lorentz
frame. We may call this the probability density. Its values, calculated
in different Lorentz frames for Wave functions representing the same
state, should be connected like the time components in these franles

.of some 4-vector. Further, the 4-dimensional divergence of this 4-

vector should vanish, signifying conservation of the electron, or that
the electron cannot appear or disappear in any volume Without passing
through the boundary.

For brevity it is convenient t0 introduce the symbol a, = I and to

suppose that the suffixes of the four up (a x 0, 1, 2, 3) can be raised
in accordance With the rules (l), even though these four 08s do not
form the components of a 4-vector. We can now Write the Wave

equation (11) {aib(pp+efﬁ_A}L)_Oﬁ)nq'n6}¢ = ()_ (13)
The four at‘ satisfy

oapcxnlcxv-l-cxvcxhuorl“ = ggPvocnl (l4)
with g1“ defined by (2), as one can verify by taking separately the cases
when u and v are both O, when one of them is 0, and When neither of

them is 0.
Let us apply an infinitesimal Lorentz transformation and distinguish

quantities referring to the new frame of reference by a star. The com-
ponents of the 4-vector p” will transform according to equations of

m“ W1” Pi = P,,.+@,£’P.,, (15)

Where the a" are small numbers of the first order. We shall neglect
quantities that are quadratic in the a's and thus of the second order.
The condition for a Lorentz transformation is that
PM?” = 2am”,

which gives “pvﬁvf-w-l-Pa a” v = 9,

leading to aI-W-l-WP = 0. (16)
The components of A,, will transform according to the same law, so

We have
pp-l-EB/(LAJL = p:+€/6.A:——a;,_”(pf+€/CJ13‘).

Thus the Wave equation (13) becomes
{(q#--@ha’(#)(pj+e/c.’A:)_@mm@}¢ = 0_ (17)
Define M = it» ocpcxm or“. (18)
Then from (l4)

= _¢1,puap
with the help of (l6), and hence
cxP"(I—|-o¢mM) = (l+Mam)(a~-ap»ap). (19)
Thus, multiplying (I 7) by (l-I-Mcxm) on the left, We get

s60 RELATIVISTIC THEORY OF THE ELECTRON §68
S0 if we put (ld-ﬂm MW = 95*» (20)
we get {al*(pf_+e/c.A:)—a,,,mc}¢* = 0. (21)

This is of the same fornl as (l 3)with the starred variables pi, AZ, W“,
and shows that (l 3)is invariant under an inﬁnitesimal Lorentz trans-
formation, provided 55 is subjected to the right transformation, given
by (20). A ﬁnite Lorentz transformation can be built up from infinite-
simal ones, so under a finite Lorentz transformation the wave equation
(13) is also invariant. Note that the matrices w“ do not get altered at all.

The invariance proved above means that the solutions 5b of the
original wave equation (l3) are in one-one correspondence with the
solutions 1/1"‘ of the new wave equation (21), corresponding solutions
being connected by (20). We assume that corresponding solutions
represent the same physical state. We must now verify that the
physical interpretations of corresponding solutions, referred to their
respective Lorentz frames of reference, are in agreement. This requires
that ﬁll/J should give the probability density referred to the original
frame and 1,5*l¢* the probability density referred to the new frame.
Let us examine the relationship between these quantities. $50 is the
same as gZlaOQB and forms one of the four quantities illlowgb, which should
be treated together.

Equations (l 8)and (l 6)show that M is pure imaginary. Thus the
conjugate imaginary of equation (20) is

'75:“ z $l(1“-M°¢wt)-
'/7*l@"‘¢* = ~.Z*(1—-Mam)@~(1+~mM)$
Z  "T-Moimﬂl +Mana)(oﬁp_ﬂavpoiv)¢
from (l 9). This reduces to
=/7*”<>¢”¢* = a5*(@**——@,l*<x”)¢
= s5*<>¢*‘¢+a“vs5*a”¢

with the help of (l 6). If we lower the suffix p. here, we get an equation
of the same form as (l5), which shows that the four quantities gblaptﬁ
transform like the contravariant components of a é-vector. Thus JJ-lgb
transforms like the time component of a 4-vector, which is the correct
transformation law for a probability density. The space components
of the 4-vector, namely gbloc, 3b, if multiplied by c, give the probability

current, or the probability of the electron crossing unit area per
unit time.

Hence

It should be not$d that zﬁlamiﬁ is invariant, since
‘Fktoma = ilﬂﬂllfcxmﬁaamﬂ-I-ozm

We must verify ﬁnally the conservation law, that the divergence

vanishes. T0 prove this, multiply equation (13) by all on the left.
The result is

The conjugate imaginary equation is

Which just expresses the vanishing of (22). In this Way We complete
the proof that our theory gives consistent results in Whichever frame
of reference it is applied.
