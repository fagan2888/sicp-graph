#45. Application to radiation

In the preceding section a general theory of the perturbation of an
atomic system was developed, in which the perturbing energy could
vary with the time in an arbitrary way. A perturbation of this
kind can be realized in practice by allowintg incident electromagnetic

radiation to fall 0n the system. Let us see What our result (24) reduces

to in this case.

If We neglect the effects of the magnetic ﬁeld of the incident radia-
tion, and if We further assume that the Wave-lengths of the harmonic
components of this radiation are all large compared With tho dimen-
sions of the atomic system, then the perturbing energy is simply the

scalar product V = (D, a} (29)

Where D is the total electric displacement of the system and é? is
the electric force of the incident radiation. We suppose é‘ to be a
given function of the time. If We take for simplicity the case When
the incident radiation is plane polarized With its electric vector in
a certain direction and let D denote the Cartesian component of D
in this direction, the expression (29) for V reduces to the ordinary

product V = DE,

From this result We see in the first place that the transition proba-
bility depends only on that Fourier component of the incident radia-
tion Whose frequency v is connected With the change of energy by (3 3).

This gives us Bohrls Frequency Condition and shows how the ideas
of Bohr's atomic theory, which was the forerunner of quantum
mechanics, can be fitted in with quantum mechanics.

The present elementary theory does not tell us anything about the
energy of the ﬁeld of radiation. It would be reasonable to assume,
though, that the energy absorbed or liberated by the atomic system
in the transition process comes from or goes into the component of
the radiation with frequency v given by (33). This assumption will
be justified by the more complete theory of radiation given in
Chapter X. The result (32) is then to be interpreted as the proba-
bility of the system, if initially in the state of lower energy, absorb-
ing radiation and being carried to the upper state, and if initially in
the upper state, being stimulated by the incident radiation to emit
and fall to the lower state. The present theory does not account for
the experimental fact that the system, if in the upper state with no
incident radiation, can emit spontaneously and fall to the lower state,
but this also will be accounted for by the more complete theory of
Chapter X.

The existence of the phenomenon of stimulated emission was in-
ferred by Einsteinj long before the discovery of quantum mechanics,
from a consideration of statistical equilibrium between atoms and a
field of black-body radiation satisfying Planck's law. Einsteinshowed
that the transition probability for stimulated emission must equal
that for absorption between the same pair of states, in agreement
with the present quantum theory, and deduced also a relation con-
necting this transition probability with that for spontaneous emission,
which relation is in agreement with the theory of Chapter X.

The matrix element (a"]D|oc'> in (32) plays the part of the ampli-
tude of one of the Fourier components of D in the classical theory of
a multiply-periodic system interacting with radiation. In fact it was
the idea of replacing classical Fourier components by matrix elements
which led Heisenberg to the discovery of quantum mechanics in 1925.
Heisenberg assumed that the formulas describing the interaction with
radiation of a system in the quantum theory can be obtained from
the classical formulas by substituting for the Fourier components of
the total electric displacement of the system the corresponding matrix
elements. According to this assumption applied to spontaneous emis-
sion, a system having an electric moment D will, when in the state

The distribution of this radiation over the different directions of
emission and its state of polarization for each direction will be the
same as that for a classical electric dipole of moment equal to the
real part of <a”|D|@J). To interpret this rate of emission of radiant
energy as a transition probability, we must divide it by the quantum
of energy of this frequency, namely 1w, and call it the probability per
unit time of this quantum being spontaneously emitted, with the
atomic system simultaneously dropping to the state a" of lower
energy. These assumptions of Heisenberg are justified by the present
radiation theory, supplemented by the spontaneous transition theory
of Chapter X.
