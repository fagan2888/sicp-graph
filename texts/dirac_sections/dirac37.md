#37. The spin of the electron

Electrons, and also some of the other fundamental particles (pro-
tons, neutrons) have a spin whose magnitude is éfi. This is found
from experimental evidence, and also there are theoretical reasons
showing that this spin value is more elementary than any other, even
spin Zero (see Chapter XI). The study of this particular spin is there-

fore of special importance.
For dealing with an angular momentum m whose magnitude is éﬁ,

it is convenient to put m _ 56 (43)
_ i _

The components of the vector a then satisfy, from (27),
01102-0"; cry = Ziax
a, aw-o-x 0'2, = 250'”, (49)
ca, cy-o-yo-x = Zia-z.

The eigenvalues of m, are i515 and -— 1%, so the eigenvalues of 0'5 are 1
and --1, and o": has just the one eigenvalue 1. It follows that a2 must

equal l, and similarly for oi and 0-5, i.e.
(50)

0'2 = 0'2 = a2 z 1

We can get equations (49) and (50) into a simpler form by means of

some straightforward non-commutative algebra. From (50)

with the help of the first of equations (49). This means 0'3, a,’ = —-a'z/ or

Two dynamical variables or Linear operators like these which satisfy
the commutative law of multiplication except for a minus sign will
be said to anticommute. Thus 0w anticommutes with a”. From sym-
metry each of the three dynamical variables am, a,” a, must anti-
commute with any other. Equations (49) may now be written

ayaz = tax — —-0'zay,

and also from (50) ca, 0y a, = z. (52)

Equations (50), (51), (52) are the fundamental equations satisﬁed by
the spin variables a describing a spin whose magnitude is 

Let us set up a matrix representation for the o's and let us take Hz
to be diagonal. If there are no other independent dynamical variables
besides the 1113s or o’s in our dynamical system, then a, by itself forms
a complete set of commuting observables, since the form of equations
(50) and (51) is such that we cannot construct out of om, oy, and 0-,,
any new dynamical variable that commutes with U5. The diagonal
elements of the matrix representing Oz being the eigenvalues 1 and
—1 of OZ, the matrix itself will be

(1 O

0 -1)'

Let ca, be represented by (:1 2:)

This matrix must be Hermitian, so that a, and a, must be real and
a, and a, conjugate complex numbers. The equation o, ox = ——o,, o,

gives us
“'1 a2 z __ a1 “a2
“as ma, a3 —a ’

so that a, = a, = 0. Hence 0x is represented by a matrix of the form

0 a2

a3 0 '
The equation o2, = l now shows that a, a, = 1. Thus a, and a,, being
conjugate complex numbers, must be of the form ei“ and e4“ re-

spectively, where o: is a real number, so that 0,, is represented by a
matrix of the form ( O 6,0,)

e4“ 0 '
Similarly it may be shown that a, is also represented by a matrix of
this form. By suitably choosing the phase factors in the representa-

tion, which is not completely determined by the condition that a,
shall be diagonal, we can arrange that ox shall be represented by the

matrix O 1

1 OI
The representative of o}, is then determined by the equation
0'1, = ﬂax Uzi We thus obtain finally the three matrices

t0 represent "om, a, and a, respectively, which matrices satisfy all the
algebraic relations (49), (50), (51), (52). The component ofthe vector
a in an arbitrary direction speciﬁed by the direction cosines l, m, n,
namely Zax-l-may-l-naz, is represented by

( n b-im). (54)

Z-I-im —n

The representative of a ket vector will consist of just two numbers,
corresponding to the two values -|- 1 and -1 for 0;. These two num-
bers form a function of the variable o’; whose domain consists of only
the two points + I and — I. The state for which 0-,, has the value unity
will be represented by the function, fc,,(o~f,) say, consisting of the pair
of numbers 1, O and that for which a, has the value —l will be
represented by the function, f,9(a_§,) say, consisting of the pair O, l.
Any function of the variable 0;, i.e. any pair of numbers, can be
expressed as a linear combination of these two. Thus any state can
be obtained by superposition of the two states for which o, equals + 1 ana’
— I respectively. For example, the state for which the component of
c: in the direction l, m, n, represented by (54), has the value +1 is
represented by the pair of numbers a, b which satisfy

( ” ‘"“")(“) " (“l

or na-l-(Z-inz-ﬂ) = a,
(l-l-im)a--nb == b.
Thus E = Zmim m 1+.” .
b 1--n Z-i-zm
This state can be regarded as a superposition of the two states for
which a, equals + 1 and —1, the relative weights in the superposition

process being as
lalg: |b|2 = [Z-imlg: (1~—-n)2 z 1—[-n: I—n. (55)
For the complete description of an electron (or other elementary
particle with spin Q5) we require the spin dynamical variables o,
whose connexion with the spin angular momentum is given by (48),
together with the Cartesian coordinates x, y, z and momenta 39x, p”,

39,. The spin dynamical variables commute with these coordinates
and momenta. Thus a complete set of commuting observables for a
system consisting of a single electron will be m, y, z, Uzi In a repre-
sentation in which these are diagonal, the representative of any state

will be a function of four variables x', y', z’, 0;. Since a; has a domain
consisting of only two points, namely 1 and — l , this function of four

variables is the same as two functions of three variables, namely the
two functions

<xfylzrl>+ i (xxyv, ZPS+1I>, <xlyfzti>n i {xfayva Zgtll). 
Thus the presence cf the spin may be considered either as introducing a

new variable into the representative cf a state or as giving this representa-
tive two components.
