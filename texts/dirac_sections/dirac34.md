#34. The harmonic oscillator

A SIMPLE and interesting example of a dynamical system in quantum
mechanics is the harmonic oscillator. This example is of importance
for general theory, because it forms a corner-stone in the theory of
radiation. The dynamical variables needed for describing the system
are just one coordinate q and its conjugate momentum p. The
Hamiltonian in classical mechanics is

H = 1%,; @2+1112111212>. <1)

Where m is the mass of the oscillating particle and w is 2w times the
frequency. We assume the same Hamiltonian in quantum mechanics.
This Hamiltonian, together with the quantum condition (10) of § 22,
deﬁne the system completely.

The Heisenberg equations of motion are

Q1 = [911 H] = Pz/m» } (2)
fpt = [Pug] = _mw2qr
It is convenient to introduce the dimensionless complex dynamical
variable v7 = (QmEwFJ-‘(p-l-imwg). (3)
The equations of motion (2) give
1}; = (2m%w)“*i(-—mw2qt+iwpt) = i001)‘.
This equation can be integrated to give
*7: = "70 61m» (4)
Where v70 is a linear operator independent of t, and is equal to the
value of 1;, at time t m 0. The above equations are all as in the
classical theory.
We can express q and p in terms of v7 and its conjugate complex if
and may thus Work entirely in terms of v7 and '5. We have
ﬁwnﬁ = (2m)"l(p+imwq)tp—imwq)
= ( 2 m)‘ ‘h2+m”w2q2+imw( 6111-99)}
= Hmyzw (5)
and similarly 111111-111 = 114-51111. (B)
Thus 1711-1111" = 1. ('7)

§34 THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR 137

Equation (5) or (6) gives H in terms of 17 and 5;‘ and (7) gives the
commutation relation connecting 17 and i. From (5)

ﬁwﬁﬂﬁ = ﬁﬂ-aﬁwﬁ

and from (6) ﬁm-Mﬁ = fjﬁ+giiwg7ﬂ
Thus 53-11;,- = ﬁwﬁ. (8)
Also, (7)leads to ﬁqn-qnﬁ = nn""1 (9)

for any positive integer n, as may be veriﬁed by induction, since, by
multiplying (9) by 17 on the left, we can deduce ( 9) with n+1 for n.

Let H’ be an eigenvalue of H and |H’> an eigenket belonging to it.
From (5)

%w<H’lnﬁ|H’> :- <H'IH—%?Y3¢=>IH'> = (H’-%7Iw)<H'IH'>-

Now (H'|q-?j|H’> is the square of the length of the ket ﬁiﬂ’), and

hence <H,I7YT.HH,> 2 0,
the case of equality occurring only if ﬁ[H’> = 0. Also (H 1H’) > 0.
Thus H’ ,2 155w, (10)

the case of equality occurring only if 1} [H ’> = 0. From the form ( I )
of H as a sum of squares, we should expect its eigenvalues to be all
positive or zero (since the average value of H for any state mush be
positive or zero). We now have the more stringent condition (10)-
From (8)

Ham» = wﬁkﬁwanﬂv = <H'-%w)ﬁ|H'>_ <11)
Now if H’ # %iiw, ﬁlli’) is not zero and is then according to (I l) an
eigenket of H belonging to the eigenvalue H’--%w. Thus, with H’
any eigenvalue of H not equal to 25am, H Q-ﬁw is another eigenvalue
of H. We can repeat the argument and infer that, if H Z-ﬁw gé éﬁw,
fIV-Zﬁw is another eigenvalue of H. Continuing in this way, we
obtain the series of eigenvalues H ’, H’—?iw, H ’-—2?iw, H ’— 3?iw,...,

which cannot extend to inﬁnitys,~,_beca.use then it would contain eigen-
values contradicting (10), and can terminate only with the value éiiw.

Again, from the conjugate complex of equation (8)
H17|H'> = (qH-}—%w17)[H'>= (IT-l-ﬁwyrﬂff’),
showing that H ﬂl-ﬁw is another eigenvalue of H , pvith »q|H’> as an

eigenket belonging to it, unless qlﬂ’) = O. The latter alternative
can be ruled out, since it would lead to

0 = ﬁwﬁﬂlff> = (H+%5w)lH’> = (H’+%?iw)|H’>,

13s ELEMENTARY APPLICATIONS §34

which contradicts (l0). Thus IT-f-iliw is always another eigenvalue
of H, and so are H "+ 21w, H ‘+33%; and so on. Hence the eigenvalues
of H are the series of numbers

1,11%, 3am,  gram,  (12)

extending to inﬁnity. These are the possible energy values for the
harmonic oscillator.

Let |O> be an eigenket of H belonging to the lowest eigenvalue
$100, SO   i 0, 

and form the sequence of kets

l9)» ﬂ|0>, 72210), ﬂslo)»  (14)

These kets are all eigenlsets of H, belonging to the sequence of eigen-
values (l2) respectively. From (9) and (l3)

ﬁwnlfl) = m2”“|0> (15)
for any non-negative integer n. Thus the set of kets (14) is such that
1; or 1'7" applied to any one of the set gives a ket dependent on the set.
Now all the dynamical variables in our problem are expressiblein terms
of w) and '5, so the kets (l4)must form a complete set (otherwisethere
would be some more dynamical variables). There is just one of these
kets for each eigenvalue (12) of H , so H by itself forms a complete
commuting set of observables. The kets (14) correspondto the various
stationary states of the oscillator. The stationary state with energy

(n-lﬁﬂiw, corresponding to 1W0), is called the nth quantum state.
The square of the length of the ket 'q'"’[0> is

<0|1rv~|<>> = "49I17“"1v”"1l0>
with the help of (l5). By induction, we ﬁnd that

<0Iﬁ”v"'|0> = n! <16)
provided l0) is normalized. Thus the kets (l4) multiplied by the
coefficients n?!’ with n = 0,1, 2,..., respectively form the basic kets
of a representation, namely the representation with H diagonal. Any
ket Ix) can be expanded in the form

1x> = vat», ' (11)

where the sags are numbers. In this way the ket Ix) is put into
correspondence with a power series 2:0,, 1;" in the variable w], the
various terms in the power series corresponding to the various
stationary states. If 1x) is normalized, it deﬁnes a state for which

§34. THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR 139

the probability of the oscillator being in the nth quantum state,
i.e. the probability of H having the value (n-l-éﬁiw, is

P” = n/Lrnlg, (18)
as follows from the same argument Which led to (5 l)of $18.

We may consider the ket |0) as a standard ket and the power series
in 1] as a Wave function, since any ket can be expressed as such a
Wave function multiplied into this standard ket. We get a kind of
Wave function differing from the usual kind, introduced by equations
(62) of § 20, in that it is a function of the complex dynamical variable
1) instead of observables. It Was first introduced by V. Fock, so We
shall call the representation F0ck’s representation. It is for many
purposes the most convenient representation for describing states of
the harmonic oscillator. The standard ket |0> satisfies the condition
(13), which replaces the conditions (43) of $22 for the standard ket
in Schrodingefs representation.

Let us introduce Schrodingefs representation With q diagonal and
obtain the representatives of the stationary states. From (l3)and (3)

(Peimwqﬂw = 0,

so <q’|p--elmwgl0> = O.
With the help of (45) of § 22, this gives

%,q.<q10>+mwq<q 10> = 0- <19)
The solution of this differential equation is
<q’l0> = (mw/willﬁvmwqwz“. (20)

We have here the representative of the normal state, as the state of
loWest energy is called. The representatives of the other stationary
states can be obtained from it. We have from (3)

(q' I n"l0> = (2mﬁw)""’2<q'l(p+imwq)"|0>

This may easily be Worked out for small values 0f"n. The result is of
the form of e"'~'"‘°q”/2” times a power series of degree n in q‘. A further
factor n14 must be inserted in (2 l) to get the normalized representa-
tive of the nth quantum state. The phase factor i" may be discarded.
