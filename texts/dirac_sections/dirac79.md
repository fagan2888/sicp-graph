#79. The interaction

The complete Hamiltonian for electrons and positrons interacting
with the electromagnetic ﬁeld is

where HF is the Hamiltonian for the electromagnetic ﬁeld alone,

given by (19) or (45), HP is the Hamiltonian for the electrons and

positrons alone, given by (8 0)or (81), and HQ is the interaction energy,
involving the dynamical variables of the electrons and positrons as
well as those of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. We take

HQ = f AP), d302, (90)

withj}, given by (7 7 )and (78), as we shall see that this gives the correct
equations of motion. Thus, with neglect of inﬁnite numerical terms,

H = f {-.F*@.<~Hv1¢r-@A'¢>+J*Qmm¢-%@A"<J*¢~¢W>} 613w —
-—-—(8'.=T)"'1 f (B, Bu-Apgpliwqdaw. (91)

Let us work out the Heisenberg equations of motion that follow
from the Hamiltonian (91). We have

Thus {alpha-gi- +614”) 4a,, m}:,b £0. (92)

This agrees with the one-electron wave equation (1 1) of Chapter XI.
Since H is real, the equation of motion for 1Z1 will be the conjugate of
the equation of motion for qé and so will agree with (12)of Chapter XI.
Thus the interaction (9 0) gives correctly the action of the ﬁeld on the
electrons and positrons. Further we have, making use of the P.B.
relations in (46),

which agrees with the Maxwell theory and shows that the interaction
(90) gives correctly the action of the electrons and positrons on the
ﬁeld.

To complete the theory we must bring in the Supplemental‘)? con-
ditions (54). We must verify that they are in agreement with the
equations of motion. The method used in § 77, which consisted in
showing that the supplementary conditions at different times in the
Heisenberg picture are consistent with one another, is no longer
applicable, because the quantum conditions connecting dynamical
variables at different times get altered by the interaction in n. way
that is too complicated to be worked out. So we shall obtain all the
supplementary conditions affecting the dynamical variables zit one
instant of time and check whether they are consistent.

We have again equations (56). A further differentiation with respect

to x0 gives Sewn/exp w o. (95)
Now the equation of motion for (b, namely (92), leads, as in § 68, to

3051.0‘); ‘T: O’
This is the same as éijp/ﬁxp = 0, (97)

because the difference between —-ez,Zl¢ and jg is constant in time, even
though it is infinite. From (95)we now see that (96) holds as a strong
equation. Thus equations (56) are the only independent supplemen-
tary conditions affecting the dynamical variables at one instant of
time. The first of them gives (57), as before, and the second now gives,
with the help of (95)for p. = 0,

(A0"-|-B,)"+4wj0 m’ 0. (98)
This may be written

(Ao-I- U)”—|—4rrjo L’ 0 (99)
or, from (39), div é‘—-4wj0 ",5 O, (100)

and is just one of the Maxwell equations.

300 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS §79

One can see without detailed calculation that, for any two points

X and X’ at the same time,
[jﬂxijﬂxai = 0:

since, from the form of (70), the P.B. must be a multiple of 8(x—-x’)
and cannot contain derivatives of 8(x--x’), while also it has t0 be anti-
symmetrical between X and X’. Thus the eXtra terms 41:35,, in equa-
tions (98)for various values of X, as compared with the corresponding
equations (58), commute with one another as well as with all the
other dynamical variables occurring in (58) and (57). It follows that
these eXtra terms will not disturb the consistency of (58) and (57),
and hence (98) and (57) are consistent.

Our method of introducing interaction into the theory was not
relativistic, since the interaction energy (90)involves the dynamical
variables at an instant of time in some Lorentz frame. It therefore
becomes questionable whether the theory with interaction is a rela-
tivistic one. Our field equations, namely (92) and (95), are evidently
relativistic and so are the supplementary conditions (54). It remains
uncertain whether the quantum conditions are Lorentz invariant.

We know the quantum conditions connecting all our dynamical
variables A px, BPX, (Lax, 1,5,“ at a given time x0. We cannot, as men-
tioned above, work out the general quantum conditions connecting
dynamical variables at any two points in space-time, because the
interaction makes it too complicated. We shall therefore make an
infinitesimal Lorentz transformation and work out the quantum con-
ditions at a given tiine in the new frame of reference. If we can estab-
lish that the quantum conditions are invariant under infinitesimal
Lorentz transformations, their invariance under finite Lorentz trans-
formations will follow.

Let w: be the time coordinate in the new frame of reference. It is
connected with the original coordinates by

x3‘ = wo-l-et/yag, (101)
where e‘ is an infinitesimal number and v, is a three-dimensional vector,
w, being the relative velocity of the two frames. We shall neglect
terms of order e2.

A field quantity K at the place X at the time 021*,‘ in the new frame
has the value
»<(x,x§) = :<(x,a:o)+(x§,“—-a:0)8i<x/6x0 = x(x,xo)+ev,_ x,.[:<x,I-II_

If 1< and A are 5b or 1,5 variables, we should be interested in their anti-
commutator instead of their P.B. Using the notation (69) for the
anticommutator, we have

(104)
With K and A any two of the basic variables A,, B”, (ha, $0,, the P.B.

[KXJXJ or anticommutator [Kw Ax"]+) as the case may be, is a number,
and so the last term in (103) or (lO4)vanishes. We are left with
[*<(X,~"<»‘Z‘1‘),I\(X'=$3‘)]_t = [K(X»%O)J\(X’,$O)]i+

-|—e?),.(x;. --:v,,)[:<,,, Dr, HP-f-HF-Hi —|—ev,.(x;.—x,.)[;<x, LA,“ HQHZE , (105)
where [KJ]: denotes the P.B. or the anticommutator, as the case may
be. From the form (90) for HQ we see that [hxa HQ] can involve only
the dynamical variables A,,,, 550x’, 1,6,“, and cannot involve any deriva-
tives of these variables. It follows that {Kw [Aw HQ]? if it does not
vanish, will be a multiple of 8(X—-X’) and will not contain terms with
derivatives of 5(X--X'). Hence the last term of (105) vanishes. We
can conclude that [»<(X,xj'§),/\(x’,x§)]i has the same value as when
there is no interaction, and is thus Lorentz invariant from our earlier
work.

A possible criticism of the above proof-should be noted. At several
places we worked out expressions in powers of e and neglected e2.
Such a procedure cannot be valid for calculating [K($),)\(x')]i with X
and X‘ two general points in space-time lying close together, so that
avg-x; is of order s, because the result of the calculation should be
a function of the (xPHxLYS having a singularity when the 4-vector
X-x‘ lies on the light-cone and such a function, of course, cannot be
expanded as a power series in the (xpwxkfs.

302 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS §79

To validate the argument we should reformulate it so as to avoid
the use of the 8 function. Instead of evaluating [:<(x,x§),)l(x’,x§)]i,
we should evaluate

[fax :<(X, mg‘) d350, I ZJXJQX’, x3‘) d3x'L, (106)

Where ax and bx are two arbitrary continuous functions of x,, x2, x3.
Then the quantities that we need to expand in powers of e all vary
continuously with a continuous change in the direction of the time»
axis, and the expansions are justifiable. The equations that we now
get are those of the previous argument multiplied by ax bx, d3xd3x’
and integrated. We are led to the same conclusion—that the P.B.
or anticommutator has the same value as when there is no interaction.
It will be seen that the reason why the interaction does not disturb
the quantum conditions is because it is so simple, involving only the
basic dynamical variables and not their derivatives. The P.B.s and
anticommutators have the same values as with no interaction pro-
vided they refer to variables at two points in space-time that are at
the same time with respect to some observer. This means the two
points must be outside each other's light-cones and may approach
coincidence only along a path lying outside the light-cone.
