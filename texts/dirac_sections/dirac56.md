#56. Permutations as constants 0f the motion

Any symmetrical function V of the dynamical variables of all the
particles is unchanged by the application of any permutation P , so
P applied to the product VJX) affects only the factor [X>, thus

PVIX) = VP[X,\.

Hence PV = VP, (12)
showing that a symmetrical function (f the dynamical variables com-
mutes with every permutation. The Hamiltonian is a symmetrical
function of the dynamical variables and thus commutes with every
permutation. It follows that each permutation is a constant cf the
motion. This holds even if the Hamiltonian is not constant. If |Xt>
is any solution of Schrodinger7s equation of motion, P |Xt> is another.

In dealing with any system in quantum mechanics, when we have
found a constant of the motion a, we know that if for any state of
motion, cx initially has the numerical value a’, then it always has this
value, so that we can assign different numbers a’ to the different
states azid so obtain a classification of the states. The procedure is
not so straightforward, however, when we have several constants of
the motion a: which do not commute (as is the case with our permuta-
tions P since we cannot in general assign numerical values for all
the a's siinultaneously to any state. Let us first take the case of a
system ‘whose Hamiltonian does not involve the time explicitly. The
existence of constants of the motion on which do not commute is

then a sign that. the system is degenerate. This is because, for a

non-degenerate system, the Hamiltonian H by itself forms a complete
set of commuting observables and hence, from Theorem 2 of § 19, each
of the ofs is a function of H and therefore commutes with any other or.

We must now look for a function B of the a's which has one and
the same numerical value B’ for all those states belonging to one
energy-level H’, so that We can use B for classifying the energy-levels
of the system. We can express the condition for B by saying that it
must be a function of H and must therefore commute with every
dynamical variable that comniutes With H, i.e. with every constant
of the motion. If the ofs are the only constants of the motion, or if
they are a set that commute With all other independent constants of
the motion, our problem reduces to finding a function B of the a's
which commutes With all the a's. We can then assign a numerical
value B’ for B to each energy-level of the system. If We can find
several such functions B, they must all commute With each other, so
that We can give them all numerical values simultaneously. We ob-
tain thus a classification of the energy-levels. When the Hamiltonian
involves the time explicitly one cannot talk about energy-levels, but
the B’s will still give a useful classification of the states.

We follow this method in dealing with our permutations P. We
must find a function X of the P’s such that PXPJ = X for every P.
It is evident that a possible X is 2 PC, the sum of all the permutations
in a certain class c, i.e. the sum of a set of similar permutations, since
Z PB, P4 must consist of the same permutations summed in a differ-
ent order. There will be one such X for each class. Further, there can
be no other independent X, since an arbitrary function of the P's can
be expressed as a linear function of them With numerical coefficients,
and it Will not then commute With every P unless the coefficients of
similar P's are always the same. ‘We thus obtain all the X’s that can
be used for classifying the states. It is convenient to deﬁne each X as
an average instead of a sum, thus

' Where n0 is the number of P's in the class c. An alternative expression

for Xe is X6 = n14. 2 PFC P-l’ (13)

the sum being extended over all the n! permutations P , it being easy
to verify that this sum contains each member of the class c the same

number of times. For each permutation P there is one X, X(P) say,

§56 PERMUTATIONS AS CONSTANTS OF THE MOTION 215

equal to the average of all permutations similar t0 P. One of the
>58 is x(P1) = 1-

The constants of the motion X1, X2,..., Xm obtained in this Way Will
each have a deﬁnite numerical value for every stationary state of the
system, in the case When the Hamiltonian does not involve the time
explicitly, and also in the general case can be used for classifying
the states, there being one set of states for every permissible set of
numerical values X1, Xf,,..., X}, for the X’s. Since the X’s are ahvays
constants of the motion, these sets of states Will be exclusive, i.e.
transitions Will never take place from a state in one set to a state in
another.

The permissible sets of values X’ that one can give to the X’s are
limited by the fact that there exist algebraic relations between the
X’s. The product of any two X’s, X,, Xq, is of course expressible as
a linear function of the P's, and since it commutes With every P it
must be expressible as a linear function of the X’s, thus

X39 Xq 2 a1X1+a2X2+---+@mXm= 

Where the a's are numbers. Any numerical values X’ that one gives
to the X’s must be eigenvalues of the X’s and must satisfy these same
algebraic equations. For every solution X’ of these equations there
is one exclusive set of states. One solution is evidently X}, = 1 for
every Xp, giving the set of symmetrical states. A second obvious
solution, giving the set of antisymmetrical states, is X}, = i1, the
+ or — sign being taken according to Whether the permutations in
the class p are even or odd. The other solutions may be Worked out
in any special case by ordinary algebraic methods, as the coefficients
a in (14) may be obtained directly by a consideration of the types
of permutation to Which the X’s concerned refer. Any solution is,
apart from a certain factor, What is called in group theory a characfer
of the group of permutations. The X’s are all real dynalnical variables,
since each P and its conjugate complex P“ are similar and Will occur
added together in the definition of any X, so that the X”s must be all
real numbers.

The number of possible solutions of the equations (l4) may easily?
be determined, since it must equal the number of different eigen-
values of an arbitrary function B of the X’s. We can express B as
a linear function of the X’s with the help of equations (l4); thus

B = b1X1+b2 X2+~~+bmXm- (15;

216 SYSTEMS CONTAINING SEVERAL SIMILAR PARTICLES $56

Similarly, we can express each of the quantities B2, B3,", B“ as a
linear function of the X’s. From ‘the m equations thus obtained,
together with the equation X(P1)_: l, we can eliminate the m un-
knowns X1, X2,..., Xm, obtaining as result an algebraic equation of
degree m for B,

Bm+c1Bm"1-I—c2Bm-2+...+c,,, = 0.

The m solutions of this equation give the m possible eigenvalues
for B, each of which Will, according to (15), be a linear function of b1,
b2,..., bm whose coefficientsare a permissible set of values x1, X§,,..., XIn.
The sets of values X’ thus obtained must be all different, since if
there were fewer than m different permissible sets of values X’ for the
X’s, there would exist a linear function of the X’s every one of whose
eigenvalues vanishes, which would mean that the linear function itself
vanishes and the X’s are not linearly independent. Thus the number of
permissible sets of numerical values for the X’s is just equaltom, which
is the number of classes of permutations or the number of partitions
of n. This number is therefore the number of exclusive sets of states.
All dynamical variables of physical importance and all observable

quantities are symmetrical between the particles and thus commute
with all the P's. Thus the only functions of the P's of physical

importance are the X’s. The states corresponding to IX’) and to
f(P)I X’), where IX’) is any eigenket of the X’s belonging to t-he eigen-
values X’ and f(P) is any function of the Fs such thatf(P)IX’) # 0,
are observationally indistinguishable and are thus physically equiva-

lent. There is a definite number, n( X’) say, of independent kets which
can be formed by multiplying IX’) by functions of the P's, which
number depends only on the X”s. It is the number of rows and

columns in a matrix representation of the P's in which each X is
equal to X’. If IX’) corresponds to a stationary state, nIX’) will be
its degree‘ of degeneracy (so far as concerns degeneracy caused by the
symmetry between the particles). This degeneracy cannot be removed

by any perturbation that is symmetrical between the particles.
