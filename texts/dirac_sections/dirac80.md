#80. The physical variables

A ket IP) that represents a physical state must satisfy thk supple-
mentary conditions

(B0-|-A,")|P> = o, (div é‘--4wj0)]P> = 0. (107)
A dynamical variable is physical if, when multiplied into any ket

satisfying these conditions, it gives another ket satisfying these con-
ditions. This requires that it shall commute with the quantities

B,+A,r, div <§-471j0. (108)

Let us see what simple dynamical variables have this property.

The transverse field variables $14,, ﬁ, evidently commute with the
quantities (108) and are physical. The variable 1p“ commutes with
the first of the quantities (108) but not the second and is thus not
physical. We have

iﬁ[‘1bax>‘rL-bx"¢bx'] W‘; (‘ﬂax Lpbx'+$bx'¢ax)¢bx'
"t: sabg(xﬁqx’)lllbx' T“ L/Iax8(X_*X')°
Thus MaxJox] = 5633-25.». 3(X~"X’)- (109)

From (42) _ _ _
[ewVx/h, div Q5] = 4wie/h.e""’VX/”8(X—x').

Thus if We put ¢fz=x z gieVX/hllbux’ (110)

$3} is physical. The variables .21., $1., tpfj, 55f; are the only independent
physical variables, apart from the quantities (108) themselves.

We have

i. = ~16<$=61¢=6-~¢1=61J=1>. .11.: 6~@»1'*16111*~ (111)
Thus the charge density and current are physical. Also it is easily
seen that é and l?‘ are physical, just as in the case When there are
no electrons and positrons present. All those variables are physical
that are unaffected by the arbitrariness that exists in the electro-
magnetic potentials in the Maxwell theory.
The operator gbax represents the creation of a positron or the
annihilation of an electron at the place x. Let us see What is the
physical signiﬁcance of the operator gbﬁx. From (4 4)

1111t66611=16.@..»1 = <1<116V116<16.—61=;>|x—x'|~6.
61161 1161166 11601:... m = 11tzx<x.—-x;>|x—x'v6
or 5m’ $21} = gb§x{€,.x.+e(x;.—x,.)|x’--x|"3}. (112)
Take a state ]P) for which é‘, at a certain point x' certainly has the

numerical value 0,, so that
 “t Grip)‘
Then from (112)
6m’ 1153A?) = {<1,~+6(x§---'1%~)IX’—-XI"3}¢1§=<IP>,
so for the state ghiﬂp), 6,. at the point x' certainly has the value
c,.+e(x§.-—x,.)[X’-—-X|"3.

This means that the operator gbﬁx, besides creating a positron or annihi-
lating an electron at the point x, increases the electric ﬁeld at the
point x’ by e(:c;—~x,.)|x’-~x["3, Which is just the classical Coulomb
ﬁeld at x' of a positron With charge e at the point x. Thus the operator
gbﬁx creates a positron at the point x together with/its Ooztlomb ﬁeld,

or else annihilates an electron at x together with its Coulomb ﬁeld.

ﬁeld it is the variables $*, F‘, rather than the variables 5b, i, that
correspond t0 the physical processes of creation and annihilation of
electrons and positrons, since these processes must always be accom-
panied by the appropriate Coulomb change in the electric ﬁeld around
the point where the particle is created or annihilated. It is easily seen
that the variables 1/111}, 1,51‘, satisfy the same anticommutation relations

(70) as the unstarred variables. When we pass to the momentum
representation the important quantities will be, not the unphysical
variables 1,6,, deﬁned by (67), but the physical variables 1,01‘; deﬁned by

‘i: = he f ei<xp>m¢r d3 , a = H f e-isﬁplw: m. (113)
We must now replace (68) by

and take 5;‘ to represent the annihilation of an electron of momentum

p, 5’; the creation of an electron of momentum p, Zﬁ the creation of
a positron of momentum ---p and Zﬁ the annihilation of a positron

of momentum ——p. The variables (b; Q, ﬁ, 5:, ﬁ, ff,‘ will all satisfy
the same anticommutation relations as the corresponding unstarred

variables.
We can express the Hamiltonian entirely in terms of physical

variables. We have

We may use H* instead of H as our Hamiltonian. It leads t0 me
same Schrodinger equation for a physical ket, since if |P) is physical

H HP) = H |P).
Also it leads to the same Heisenberg equations of motion for physical
variables, since if E is a physical variable

[arm w £5.11)»
Thus H * and H are equivalent Hamiltonians for the physical quanti-
ties, and the others do not matter.

H* involves only physical variables. The longitudinal ﬁeld variables
do not appear in it. Instead of them We have the last term of (114),
Which is just the Coulomb interaction energy of any charges that are
present. The appearance of such a term in a relativistic theory is
rather strange, as it is an energy associated With the instantaneous
propagation of forces. It appears as a result of our having transformed
the theory a long Way from the Heisenberg form in Which the relati-
vistic invariance of the theory is manifest.

We could set up a representation by taking as standard ket the
product of the standard ket |OF> for the electromagnetic ﬁeld alone,
given by (61) and (62), with the standard ket 10p) for the electrons
and positrons alone, given by (74). This representation Would not be
a convenient one, however, because its standard ket does not satisfy
the second of the supplementary conditions (107).

We get a more convenient representation if We take another stan-
dard ket 1Q) satisfying

(BO-I-Af) IQ) = 0, (div<§—-41rj0)§Q) = 0, (115)

 Z O: zzkpiQ> z 0:  Z  

These conditions are consistent, because the operators on |Q> in
them all commute or anticommute With each other, and there are
enough of them to fix IQ) completely, apart from a numerical factor,

306 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS § 80

because there are as many of them as of the conditions for IOFHOP).
The conditions (115) show that |Q) satisﬁes the supplementary con-
ditions and so represents a physical state. The conditions (1 16) show
that IQ) represents a state for wlrich there are no photons, electrons,
or positrons present.

Any ket IP) that satisﬁes the supplementary conditions (107) and
so represents a physical state can be expressed as some physical
variable multiplied into IQ). The only independent physical vari-

ables that give non-vanishing results when applied to |Q> are Mm
.1‘ * . Hence -

‘w’ “P IP) == ‘F0941, 2-1» ZPHQ) (117)
Thus IP) is represented by a wave functional ‘T’ involving the variables
ix, lip, jfp. It is a power series in these variables, the various terms
in it corresponding to the existence of various numbers of photons,
electrons, and positrons, with the Coulomb ﬁelds around the electrons
and positrons.

In using the representation (1 1 7) together with the Hamiltonian H *,

we have a form of the theory in which we can ignore the conditions.

(115), asﬁohey have no effect on the kets (117). We must retain the
conditions (116). The longitudinal variables then no longer appear
in the theory.
