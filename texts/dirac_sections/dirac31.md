#31. The motion 0f Wave packets

The result just deduced for a free particle is an example of a general
principle. For any dynamical system With a classical analogue, a state
for Which the classical description is valid as an approximation is
represented in quantum mechanics by a Wave packet, all the co-
ordinates and momenta having approximate numerical values, Whose
accuracy is limited by Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty. Now
Schrodinger's Wave equation ﬁxes hoW such a Wave packet varies With
time, so in order that the classical description may remain valid, the
Wave packet should remain a Wave packet and should move according
to the laWs of classical dynamics. We shall verify that this is so.

We take a dynamical system having a classical analogue and let
its Hamiltonian be H (q,., p,,) (r= 1, 2,..., n). The corresponding classi-
cal dynamical system will have as Hamiltonian Egg” p,,) say, obtained
by putting ordinary algebraic variables for the g, and p, in H (gr, p,,)
and making 5 -->- 0 if it occurs in H(g,., p,.). The classical Hamiltonian
H, is, of course, a real function of its variables. It is usually a
quadratic function of the momenta p,, but not always so, the
relativistic theory of a free particle being an example Where it is not.
The followingargument is valid for H, any algebraic function of thep's.

We suppose that the time-dependent Wave function in Schro-
dinger's representation is of the form

zﬂqt) = AGE/n, <35)

Where A and S are real functions of the q's and t Which do not vary
very rapidly With their arguments. The Wave function is then of the
form of Waves, With A and S determining the amplitude and phase
respectively. Schrodinger's Wave equation (7) gives

mfgeislo = H<q..p.>AetS/’~>

or {iﬁ g — A $55)) = e"':57nH(q,., p,.)A @1351“). (36)

122 THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION §31

Now e45!" is evidently a unitary linear operator and may be used for
U in equation (70) of § 26 t0 give us a unitary transformation. The
q’s remain unchanged by this transformation, each p, goes over into

z/iSlﬁ reiSlh z 2)r_|_3S/3qr’
xvith the help of (31) of § 22, and H goes over into
e-ielﬁﬂ<q._.p.>ei=slﬁ = Her. p.+@8/@q.>.

since algebraic relations are preserved by the transformation. Thus
(3 6) becomes

. .8A 8S 8
{@h~é;-Agé;}> = H(q...p.+5§¢4>. <31)

Let us now suppose that h can be counted as small and let us neglect;
terms involving ii in (3 7). This involves neglecting the pfs that occur
in H in (37), since each p, is equivalent to the operator @2171 EJ/Bg,
operating on the functions of the gfs to the right of it. The surviving

terms give as 3S
“*5; i c(gr> 

This is a differential equation which the phase function S has to
satisfy. The equation is determined by the classical Hamiltonian
function HO and is known as the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in classical
dynamics. It allows S to be real and so shows that the assumption
of the wave form (3 5) does not lead to an inconsistency.

To obtain an equation for A , we must retain the terms in (3 7)
which are linear in ﬁ and see what they give. A direct evaluation of
these terms is rather awkward in the case of a general function H,
and we can get the result we require more easily by first multiplying
both sides of (3 7)by the bra vector (Af, wheref is an arbitrary real
function of the q's. This gives

. 3A 8S 8

The conjugate complex equation is

. A S S
<Af{~@%%;-A%;}> = <AH(q..p.+-%)rA>.

Subtracting and dividing out by 21%, we obtain

§31 THE MOTION OF WAVE PACKETS 123

We now have t0 evaluate the P.B.

[f1 

Our assumption that A can be counted as small enables us t0 expand
H (q._,., p,.+ 6S/6g,.) as a power series in the p's. The terms of zero degree
will contribute nothing to the P.B. The terms of the first degree in
the p's give a contribution to the P.B. which can be evaluated most
easily With the help of the classical formula (l) of § 21 (this formula
being valid also in the quantum theory if u is independent of the p’s
and v is linear in the p's). The amount of this contribution is

the notation meaning that We must substitute ﬁS/Eﬂq, for each p, in
the function [ ] of the q's andp's, so as to obtain a function of the g’s
only. The terms of higher degree in the p's give contributions to the
P.B. which vanish When 7:, -->~ O. Thus (39) becomes, with neglect of
terms involving ﬁ, which is equivalent to the neglect of £2 in (37),

provided a(q) and b(q) satisfy suitable boundary conditions, as dis-

This is the equation for the amplitude A of the Wave function. To
get an understanding of its signiﬁcance, let us suppose We have a ﬂuid
moving in the space of the variables q, the density of the ﬂuid at any
point and time being A2 and its velocity being

124 THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION §31

Equation (42) is then just the equation of conservation for such a
ﬂuid. The motion of the ﬂuid is determined by the function S
satisfying (38), there being one possible motion for each solution
of (38).

For a given S, let us take a solution of (42) for which at some
deﬁnite time the density A2 vanishes everywhere outside a certain
small region. We may suppose this region to move with the ﬂuid,
its velocity at each point being given by (43), and then the equation
of conservation (42) will require the density always to vanish outside
the region. There is a limit to how small the region may be, imposed
by the approximation we made in neglecting 1'2’. in (39). This approxi-
mation is valid only provided

which requires that A shall vary by an appreciable fraction of itself
only through a range of the gfs in which S varies by many times A

i.e. a range consisting of many wavelengths of the wave function (35).

Our solution is then a wave packet of the type discussed in § 24 and
remains so for all time.

We thus get a wave function representing a state of motion for
which the coordinates and momenta have approximate numerical
values throughout all time. Such a state of motion in quantum
theory corresponds to the states with which classical theory deals.
The motion of our Wave packet is determined by equations (38) and
(43). From these we get, defining p, as 8S/8gs,

where in the last line the gfs are counted as independent of the g’s
before the partial differentiation. Equations (43) and (44) are just
the classical equations of motion in Hamiltonian form and show that
the wave packet moves according to the laws of classical mechanics.

We see in this way how the classicalequations of motion are derivable
from the quantum theory as a limiting case.

.By a more accurate solution of the wave equation one can show
that the accuracy with which the coordinates and momenta simul-
taneously have numerical values cannot remain permanently as
favourable as the limit allowed by Heisenberg's principle of un-
certainty, equation (56) of § 24, but if it is initially so it will become
less favourable, the wave packet undergoing a spreadingtf
