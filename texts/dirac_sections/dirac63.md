#63. The interaction energy between photons and an atom

We shall now determine the interaction energy between an atom
and an assembly of photons, i.e. the HQ of equation (53), from
analogy with the classical expression for the interaction energy
between an atom and a field of radiation. For simplicity we shall
suppose the atom to consist of a single electron moving in an electro-
static field of force. The field of radiation may be described by a
scalar and a vector potential. These potentials are to a certain extent
arbitrary and may be chosen so that the scalar potential vanishes.
The field is then completely described by the vector potential A,, A,,
A,, or A. The change that the field. causes in the Hamiltonian
describing the atom is now, as explained at the beginning of § 41,

H = él-{(P+§A)2“p2} = ilémmqh

This is the classical interaction energy. The A that occurs here should
be the value of the vector potential at the point where the electron is
momentarily situated. It is, however, a good enough approximation
if we take this A to be the vector potential at some fixed point in the
atom, such as the nucleus, provided we are dealing with radiation
whose wavelength is large compared with the dimensions of the atom.

24o THEORY OF RADIAJTION gas

Let us first consider the ﬁeld of radiation classically and ignare its
interaction with the atom. The vector potential A satisﬁes, according
to Maxwell's theory, the equations

DA: 0, divA=0, (62)

III being short for 82/02 69-»82/8m2--82/8y2~—82/3z2. The ﬁrst of these

equations shows that A can be resolved into Fourier coinponents in
the form

A I I {AR e—-'i(kx)+21r2'vk1 +31‘ eimxy-ewivkr} disk (63)

each Fourier coinponent representing a train of waves Inoving with
the velocity of light, described by a vector k whose direction gives

the direction of motion of the waves and whose magnitude [k] is
connected with their frequency 11k by

211v!‘ = CIR]. (64)

The vector k is just the momentum of a photon which the quantum
theory would associate with these waves, divided by f2. For each
value of k we have an amplitude A,, which is in general a complex
vector, and the integral in (63) extends over the whole of the three-
dimensional k-space. The second of equations (62) gives .

(k, A,,) = 0, (65)
showing that, for each value of k, A, is perpendicular t0 k. This
expresses that the waves are transverse waves. A, 1s determined by

its two components in two directions perpendicular to each other and

to k, these two components corresponding to two independent states
of linear polarization.

The total energy of the radiation is given by the volume integral

HR i: (em-l f (e2+#2)d3e (e6)

taken over the whole of space, where the electric ﬁeld é‘ and the
magnetic ﬁeld J2‘ of the radiation are given by

Using standard formulas of vector analysis, we have
div[AXJ#] = (&, curlA)--(A,curl.#) = ﬂl- (A,curlcurlA)
= ﬁz-l-(AVZA)
with the help of the second of equations (62). Thus (66) becomes,

By substituting for A here its value given by (63), We can get the
energy of the radiation in terms of the Fourier amplitudes A,. The
energy of the radiation is constant (since We are now ignoring the
interaction of the radiation and the atom), so in this calculation We
may take t = 0. This means taking

A = f (A,+'A'__k)@~"i<*v<>d3k, (69)

Inserting these expressions in (68), We get

With the help of formula (49) of §23, 5(k+k') being the product of
three factors, one for each component of k. Hence

We can replace the continuous distribution of k-values by a dust of
discrete k-values,,like We did With the p-values in the preceding
section. The integral (71) then goes over, according to formula (52),

this as HR 2 4E2 k2} kzA-klgkl 81?, (72)

A,, being a component of A, in a direction l perpendicular to k and

242 THEORY OF RADIATION §63

'the summation with respect to 1 referring to two directions 1 perpen-
dicular to each other. Thus there is one term in (72) for each inde-
.pendent stationary state for a photon.

The ﬁeld quantities é‘ and if at any point x can be looked upon
as dynamical variables. The quantities

- "' ..__ ' -2 ' z
AK“ z Am e21r1v1; i] Ah“ ____ Ame; 171v;

are then dynamical variables at time t, since they are connected with
é‘ and f?‘ at various points x at time t by equations which do not
involve t, as follows from (63)and (67). A,, is constant, so AW varies
with t according to the simple harmonic law. Thus A,,, is Like the n;
of a harmonic oscillator, deﬁned by (3) of § 34, the w of the oscillator
being 2¢rvk. We may take each AW to be proportional to the "q, of
some harmonic oscillator and then the ﬁeld of radiation becomes a
set of harmonic oscillators.

Let us now pass over to the quantum theory and take the A,,,, Hm,
to be dynamical variables in the Heisenberg picture. The expression
(72) for the energy may be retained unchanged, the order in which
the factors A,,, 21k, there occur being the correct one to give no zero-
point energy. The A,,, then still vary with time according to the eiw‘
law and may still be taken to be proportional to the nfs of harmonic
oscillators. The factor of proportionality may be obtained by equat-
ing (72)to the expression (39) for the energy, with the label a replaced
by the two labels k and 1 and with hvk for ﬁwa. This gives

the sufﬁx t being inserted to show that we are dealing with Heisenberg
dynamical variables (as we should when transferring equations of the
classical theory to the quantum theory). Hence, using (64),

4WZA klt x Chivilﬁklt Sin (73)

with neglect of an unimportant arbitrary phase factor. In this way
the Heisenberg dynamical variables 17w, which describe the ﬁeld of
radiation as a set of oscillators, are introduced. The commutation

relations between the 17m, and vim, are known, being given by (11), so
equation (73) ﬁxes the commutation relations between the A,,, and

Amt. It thus ﬁxes the commutation relations between the potentials
A and the ﬁeld quantities é‘ and i?‘ at various points X at the time t.

(Incidentally, the commutation relations of the A,,, Am are ﬁxed,

§63 INTERACTION ENERGY BETWEEN PHOTONS AND AN ATOM 243

so the commutation relation of two potential or ﬁeld quantities at
two different times is also ﬁxed.)

We can still use (73) when the interaction between the ﬁeld of
radiation and the atom is taken into account. This involves assuming
that the interaction does not affect the commutation relations
between the potentials and ﬁeld quantities at a given time. The
interaction causes the qklfs to cease to vary according to the simple
harmonic law and the oscillators to cease to be harmonic. Thus it
may affectthe commutation relation between two potential or ﬁeld
quantities at two different times.

We can now take over the interaction energy (6l)into the quantum
theory, putting p, for p to show it is a Heisenberg dynamical variable.
Taking the atomic nucleus to be at the origin we get, by substituting
(63)with X = 0 into (61).

With the model of the atom we are using, the interaction energy
appears as a linear plus a quadratic function in the 17’s and '53s. The
linear terzns give rise to emission and absorption processes, the

244 THEORY OF RADIATION §63

quadratic ones t0 scattering processes and processes in which two
photons are absorbed or emitted simultaneously. The order of the
factors v7 and F) in the quadratic terms is not determined by the
procedure of working from the classical theory, but this order is
unimportant, since a change in it merely changes HQ by a constant.

The matrix element of HQ referring to the emission of a photon
into the discrete state kl, or into the discrete state p’l, as it may also
be labelled, with the atom jumping from state 04° to state a’, is

since sk = s1, ﬁg. The p; occurring here, referring to the momentum
of the electron, is, of course, quite distinct from the other letters p,
referring to the momentum of the emitted photon. To avoid con-
fusion we shall replace the electron momentum p by mi, these two
dynamical variables being the same for the unperturbed atom. Pass-
ing over to continuous photon states by means of the conjugate

there being two terms in (74) which contribute to it. These matrix

referring to the simultaneous absorption or emission of two photons
may be written down in the same way, but they lead to physical
effects too small to be of practical importance.
