#36. Properties of angular momentum

There are some general properties of angular momentum, deducible
simply from the commutation relations between the three compo-
nents. These properties must hold equally for spin and orbital angular
momentum. Let m, my, m, be the three components of an angular
momentum, and introduce the quantity B deﬁned by

.8 = mz+ms+ma
Since B is a scalar it must commute With m,, my, and m,. Let us
suppose We have a dynamical system for which mm, my, m, are the
only dynamical variables. Then B commutes With everything and

must be a number. We can study this dynamical system on much
the same lines as We used for the harmonic oscillator in § 34.

Put mm-zmy = ":7.
From the commutation relations (27) We get

1317 =-=_ (m_.c+imy)(m$—~imy) = mi-I-mi-vlmx my-my mm)

= ﬁ~mg+ﬁmz (34)
and similarly 171‘; m ﬁmmﬁ-ﬁmz. (35)
Thus ﬁwgmqﬁ = 2am, (36)
A150 man-um, = ¢zm,,-2am, ..-.. 4:1,. (37)

We assume that the components of an angular momentum are
observables and thus m, has eigenvalues. Let m; be one of them,
and [mfg an eigenket belonging to it. From (34)

or k-f-ﬁ 2 m; 2 —k. (40)
An equality occurs if and only if 173mg) = O. Similarly from (35)
(mélﬂiilmb = (ﬁ—mé2*ﬁmé)<mélmé>,

showing that ,8—m;2—?im; 2 0

combined with (40) shows that k 2 0 and

with m; = k if ﬁlmi.) = 0 and m; = “is if 17[m;> = 0.

From (37)
mzﬂlmi) = (nmriinllmb = (mé-ﬁlolmb-
Now if m; # —l<, 171m; is not zero and is then an eigenket of ma,
belonging to the eigenvalue mg-ﬁ. Similarly, if mé-Ji 75 —k, mém-Zﬁ
is another eigenvalue of ma, and so on. We get in this way a series
of eigenvalues mg, mQ-ii, w2,_;--2?i,..., which must terminate from (41),
and can terminate only with the value ~10. Again, from the conjugate
complex of equation (37)
‘"1217 It"? = (ﬁmz-tﬁﬁﬂmb = (mkriﬁﬁlmb,

showing that mg-l-ﬁ is another eigenvalue of mg unless ﬁlmé) = 0, in
which case m; = k. Continuing in this way we get a series of eigen-
values m;,m;+ﬁ,m;+2?i,..., which must terminate from (41), and

can terminate only with the value k. We can conclude that 2k is an
integral multiple of ﬁ, and that the eigenvalues of a115, are

k, k-ﬁ, k-zh,  ~k+%, -1<. (42)

146 ELEMENTARY APPLICATIONS §35

The eigenvalues of m, and my are the same, from symmetry. These
eigenvalues are all integral or half odd integral multiples of f1, accord-
ing t0 whether 2k is an even or odd multiple of &.

Let (max) be an eigenket of m, belonging t0 the maximum eigen-

value k, so that ﬁlmax) = o, (43)

and form the sequence of kets
lmax), vﬂmax), qzlmax), ..., qgkVﬂmaxy (44)

These kets are all eigenkets of m, belonging to the sequence of eigen-
values (42)respectively. The set of kets (44)is such that the operator
17 applied to any one of them gives a ket dependent on the set (n
applied to the last gives zero), and from (36) and (43) one sees
that ﬁ applied to any one of the set also gives a ket dependent on the
set. All the dynamical variables for the system we are now dealing
with are expressible in terms of 17 and ﬁ, so the set of kets (44) is a
complete set. There is just one of these kets for each eigenvalue (42)
of m, so m, by itself forms a complete commuting set of observables.

It is convenient to deﬁne the magnitude of the angular momentum
vector In to be k, given by (39), rather than 8*, because the possible

values for k are O, g2’ ﬁ, 3%, 2%’ m’ (4:5)

extending to infinity, while the possible values for B?’ are a more
complicated set of numbers.

For a dynamical system involving other dynamical variables besides
m, my, and m,, there may be variables that do not commute with 
Then ,8 is no longer a number, but a general linear operator. This
happens for any orbital angular momentum (22), as x, y, z, p,, p,,, and

p, do not commute xvith ,8. We shall assume that B is always an
observable, and k can then be deﬁned by (39) with the positive square
root function and is also an observable. We shall call k so defined
the magnitude of the angular momentum vector In in the general
case. The above analysis by which we obtained the eigenvalues of
m, is still valid if we replace {mg} by a simultaneous eigenket 115mg)
of the commuting observables 1c and m,, and leads to the result that
the possible eigenvalues for k are the numbers (45), and for each
eigenvalue 1c’ of k the eigenvalues of m, are the numbers (42)with k‘
substituted for k. We have here an example of a phenomenon which
we have not met with previously, namely that With two commuting
observables, the eigenvalues of one depend on what eigenvalue we

§36 PROPERTIES OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM 147

assign t0 the other. This phenomenon may be understood as the two
observables being not altogether independent, but partially functions
of one another. The number of independent simultaneous eigenkets
of k and m, belonging to the eigenvalues k’ and m; must be indepen-
dent of mg, since for each independent ]?c’m;> we can obtain an
independent |l<:'m;>, for any m; in the sequence (42), by multiplying
|l::’m_§,> by a suitable power of v7 or 5i.

As an example let us consider a dynamical system with two angular
momenta m, and m2, which commute with one another. If there are
no other dynamical variables, then all the dynamical variables com-
mute with the magnitudes k1 and k2 of m, and m2, so k1 and k2 are
numbers. However, the magnitude K of the resultant angular
momentum M = ml-l-m, is not a number (it does not commute
with the components of m, and m2) and it is interesting to work out
the eigenvalues of K. This can be done most simply by a method
of counting independent kets. There is one independent simultaneous
eigenket of m, and ma, belonging to any eigenvalue wzi, having one of
the velues k,, k1—%,k1—- 26,..., —Ic1 and any eigenvalue mg, having one
of the values k2, kzwﬁ, k2—2?i,..., ““""“k2, and this ket is an eigenket
of M, belonging to the eigenvalue M Q = waiz-l-mgz. The possible
values of M; are thus k1+k2’k1+k2““%, k1+k2~2?£,...,-k1-k2, and
the number of times each of them occurs is given by the following
scheme (if we assume for definiteness that k1 2 k2),

kl-i-kz,k,+k,-+¥i,k,+k,-2%,...,k1—k,,k,—1c2—?£,...

1 2 3  2102-]- 1 2102-}- 1 (46)

2k,+1 2k,  1

Now each eigenvalue K‘ of K will be associated with the eigenvalues
KQIC-ﬁ, K'-~2%,..., WK’ for M5, with the same number of indepen-
dent simultaneous eigenkets ofK and JIQ for each of them. The total
number of independent eigenkets of M, belonging to any eigenvalue
M; must be the same, whether we take them to be simultaneous
eigenkets of m1, and m2, or simultaneous eigenkets of K and 1%, i.e.
it is always given by the scheme (46). It follows that the eigenvalues

and that for each of these eigenvalues for K and an eigenvalue for

14S ELEMENTARY APPLICATIONS §36

M, going with it there is just one independent simultaneous eigenket
of K and Mg.

The effect of rotations on eigenkets of angular momentum variables
should be noted. Take any eigenket {ML} of the z component of total
angular momentum for any dynamical system, and apply to it a small
rotation through an angle Bqﬁ about the z-axis. It will change into

<1+8¢ri>|M;>' = (1—i8¢i%/%)lﬂf;>
with the help of (32). This equals
<1—r»15¢M;/%>1M;> = B"*S¢M§"‘IML>

to the ﬁrst order in 8d». Thus 1M Q) gets multiplied by the numerical
factor e'-‘3¢M5l”. By applying a succession of these small rotations, We
ﬁnd that the application of a ﬁnite rotation through an angle gb about
the z-axis causes {M1,} to get multiplied by e"'3¢M5"". Putting qS = 2w,
we find that an application of one revolution about the z-axis leaves
IMQ) unchanged if the eigenvalue M; is an integral multiple of h and
causes IM 1,) to change sign ifM; is half an odd integral multiple of 6.
Now consider an eigenket |K’> of the magnitude K of the total angu-
lar momentum. If the eigenvalue K’ is an integral multiple of h, the
possible eigenvalues of M are all integral multiples of h and the applica-
tion of one revolution about the z-axis must leave IK’) unchanged.
Conversely, if K’ is half an odd integral multiple of h, the possible eigen-
values of M, are all half odd integral multiples of ii and the revolution
must change the sign of IK’). From symmetry, the application of a
revolution about any other axis must have the same effect on [K ’>
as one about the z-axis. We thus get the general result, the application
0f one revolution about any axis leaves a ket unchanged or changes its
sign according to whether it belongs to eigenvalues of the magnitude of
the total angular momentum. which are integral or half odd integral
multiples of 5. A state, of course, is always unaffected by the revolu-

tion, since a state is unaffected by a change of sign of the ket corre-
sponding to it.

For a dynamical system involving only orbital angular momenta,

a ket must be unchanged by a revolution about an axis, since we can
set up Schrodinger's representation, with the coordinates of all the

particles diagonal, and the Schrodinger representative of a ket will

get brought back to its original value by the revolution. It follows
that the eigerivnlues of the magnitude of an orbital angular momentum

are always integral multiples of h. The eigenvalues of a component

§33 PROPERTIES OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM 149

of an orbital angular momentum are also always integral multiples
of a5. For a spin angular momentum, Schrodinger's representation
does not exist and both kinds of eigenvalue are possible.
