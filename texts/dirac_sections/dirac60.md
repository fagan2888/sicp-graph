#60. The connexion between bosons and oscillators

In § 34 we studied the harmonic oscillator, a dynarnical system of
one degree of freedom describable in terms of a canonical q and p,
such that the Hanliltonian is a sum of squares of q and p, with
numerical coefficients. We define a general oscillator mathematically
as a system of one degree of freedom describable in terms of a
canonical q and p , such that ‘the Hamiltonian is a power series in q
and p, and remains so if the system is perturbed in any way. We
shall now study a dynamical system composed of several of these
oscillators. We can describe each oscillator in terms of, instead of
q and p, a complex dynamical variable '1], like the 17 of § 34, and its

22s THEORY OF ‘RADIATION §e0

conjugate complex $7", satisfying the commutation relation (7) of
§ 34. We attach labels 1, 2, 3,... to the different oscillators, so that
the whole set of oscillators is describable in terms of the dynamical
variables 1;], v72, n3,..., ﬁl, 152, 53,... satisfying the commutation

The n's are observables which commute with one another and the
Work of § 34 shows that each of them has as eigenvalues all non-
negative integers. For the ath oscillator there is a standard ket for
the Fock representation, 10a) say, which is a normalized eigenket of n,
belonging to the eigenvalue zero. By multiplying all these standard
kets together we get a standard ket for the Fock representation for
the set of oscillators, |O1>|02>|03>m’ (l4)

which is a simultaneous eigenket of all the n's belonging to the
eigenvalues zero. We shall denote it simply by 10>. From (13) of §34

for any a. The work of§34 also shows that, if n}, 92;, 11%,... are any
non-negative integers, 721,; ﬁg; ngaulw (16)

is a simultaneous eigenket of all the n's belonging to the eigenvalues
n}, 11;, 12.5,... respectively. The various kets (16) obtained by taking
(lifferent n"s form a complete set of kets all orthogonal to one another
and the square of the length of one of them is, from (16) of § 34,
n1!n§!n§,!=.... From this we see, bearing in mind the result (5), that
the kets (16) have just the same properties as the kets (9), so that
we can equate each ket (16) to the ket (9) referring to the same n'
values without getting any inconsistency. This involves putting

S|o¢“o¢boc°...o¢g> = 7, T”, qc...'qg|()>. (l7)

The standard ket j0> becomes equal to the first of the kets (If), corre-
sponding to no bosons present.

The effect of equation (17) is to identify the states of an assembly
of bosons with the states of a set’ of oscillators. This means that the

§ﬁO CONNFIXION BE'I.‘VV'EPIN BOSONS AND OSCILLATORS 229

dynamical system, consisting 0f an assembly of similar bosons is equiva-
lent to the dynamical system consisting of a set of oscillators-the two
systems are just the sante system looked at from two diﬁerent points of
view. There is one oscillator associated with each independent boson
state. We have here one of the most fundamental results of quantum
mechanics, which enables a uniﬁcation of the wave and corpuscular
theories of light to be effected.

Our Work in the preceding-section was built up on a discrete set
of basic kets Ia“) for a boson. We could pass to a different discrete
set of basic kets, 1B1‘) say, and build up a similar theory on them.
The basic kets for the assembly would then be, instead of (9),

l>, I5A>> Slﬁfﬁﬁb, SIBABBBOX  (18)

The first of the kets (18), referring to no bosons present, is the same
as the ﬁrst of the lasts (9). Those kets (18) referring to one boson
present are linear functions of those kets (9) referring to one boson

present, namely 778% = 2 laa><aa|ﬁA>y (19)

and generally those kets (18) referring to u’ bosons present are linear
functions of those kets (9)referring to 1t’ bosons present. Associated
with the new basic states ISA) for a boson there will be a new set
of oscillator variables 17 A, and corresponding to (17) we shall have

SIBABBBU~> = *2.u211*1o-~-l0>- (20)

Thus a ket 17A 17B... 10> with u’ factors 17A, 173,... must be a linear func-
tion of kets 17,,17;,...|0> with u’ factors 17a, 17,,,.... It follows that each
linear operator 17 A must be a linear function of the 17,,’s. Equation

(19) gm 11|<>> = g na|"><@“|ﬁ‘*>
and hence 17A Z 2 Wtﬂaal/QA} (21)

Thus the 17’s transform according to the same 11w as the basic kets for
a boson. The transformed 17’s satisfy, with their conjugate complexes,
the same commutation relations (11) as the original ones. The trans-
formed 17’s are on just the same footing as the original ones and hence,
when we look upon our dynamical system as a set of oscillators, the
different degrees of freedom have no invariant significance.

The 1‘7"s transform according to the same law as the basic bras for
a boson, and thus the same law as the numbers (aaléli) forming the

representative of a state x. This similarity people often describe by

saying that the ﬁcfs are given by a process of second quantization
applied. t0 (aalx), meaning thereby that, after one has set up a
quantum theory for a single particle and so introduced the numbers
(aalx) representing a state of the particle, one can make these num-
bers into linear operators satisfying with their conjugate complexes
the correct commutation relations, like (11), and one then has the
appropriate mathematical basis for dealing with an assembly of the
particles, provided they are bosons. There is a corresponding proce-
dure for fermions, which will be given in § 65.

Since an assembly of bosons is the same as a set of oscillators, it
must be possible to express any symmetrical function of the boson
variables in terms of the oscillator variables -q and f}. An example
of this is provided by equation (10) with '17,, 1'), substituted for n“.
Let us see how it goes in general. Take first the case of a function
of the boson variables of the form

UT = g (In (22)

where each f], is a function only of the dynamical variables of the
rth boson, so that it has a representative (oaﬂaloc?) referring to the
basic kets la?) of the rth boson. In order that UT may be symmetrical,
this representative must be the same for all r, so that it can depend
only on the two eigenvalues labelled by a and b. We may therefore

Summing this equation for all values of '2' and applying the sym-
metrizing operator S to both sides, we get

SUTkxf‘  = Z 2 81oz? o<:§=..o:f..><a|U|a¢,.>. (25)

Since UT is symmetrical we can replace SUT by UT S and can then
substitute for the symmetrical kcts in (25)their values given by (17).
We get in this way

n; meaning that the factor 17x, must be cancelled out. Now from
(15) and the commutation relations (11)

The method can readily be extended to give any symmetrical func-
tion of the boson variables in terms of the vfs and is.

The foregoing theory can easily be generalized to apply to an
assembly of bosons in interaction with some other dynamical system,
which We shall call for definiteness the atom. We must introduce a
set of basic kets, IE’) say, for the atom alone. We can then get a set
of basic kets for the Whole system of atom and bosons together by
multiplying each of the kets f?) into each of the kets (9). We may

We may look upon the system as composed of the atom in interaction
with a set of oscillators, so that it can be described in terms of the
atom variables and the oscillator variables 17a, i“. Using again the
standard ket l0) for the set of oscillators, we have

Sl€!05a°4bmc*"> = 77a rib 720" !0> |gl>r (37)
corresponding to (17), as the equation expressing the basic kets
(36) in terms of the oscillator variables.

Any function of the atom variables and boson variables which is
symmetrical between all the bosons is expressible as a function of the
atom variables and the vfs and ﬁe. Consider first a function Q. of
the form (22) with U, a function only of the atom variables and the
variables of the rth boson, so that it has arepresentative <§’a§.‘| U, {Hui}.
This representative must be independent of r in order that UT may
be symmetrical between all the bosons, so we may write it

(§’a“|U|§"ab>. Now let us define (a|U|b> to be that function of the
atom variables whose representative is (i; 'cx"‘| U Wot”), so that we have

<€'w;'-‘|U-|§"w?> = <€'@=“lUl§”cb> = <€’l<@|U|b>l€">, (38)
corresponding to (23). The equations (24)—(28):an now be taken over
and applied to the present “York if both sides of all these equations
are multiplied by l?) on the right, with the result that formula (29)
still holds. We can dsal similarly with a symmetrical function  of
the form (30) with Ks a function only of the atom variables and the
variables of the rth and sth bosons. Defining <ablV|cd> to be that
function of the atom variables whose representative is

<:'@:@21K.:c"a:e‘>,
we find that formula (35) still holds.
