#52. Resonance scattering

Suppose the energy of the incident particle to he varied con-
tinuously while the initial state a“ of the scatterer is kept fixed, so
that the total energy E’ or H’ varies continuously. The formula (44)
now shows that as E’ approaches one of the discrete set of energy-
levels Eh, the. scattering becomes very large. In fact, according to
formula (44)the scattering should be infinite when E’ is exactly equal
to an E,. An infinite scattering coefficient is, of course, physically
impossible, so that we can infer that the approximations used in
deriving (44) are no longer legitimate when E’ is close to an Ek. To
investigate the scattering in this case we must therefore go back to

the exact equation (E,_EHH,> z VIE’),
equation (2) of § 43 with E’ written for H’, and use a different method

terms of representatives like (41), becomes

Let us take one particular EL. and consider the case when E’ is close
to it. The large term in the scattering coefficient ( 4 4 )now arises from
those elements of the matrix representing V that lie in row k or in
column k, i.e. those of the type (Icllﬂpof) or <po¢’]V|7c>. The scatter-
ing arising from the other matrix elements of V is of a smaller order
of magnitude. This suggests that in our exact equations ( 4 5 )we should
make the approximation of neglecting all the matrix elements of V
except the important ones, which are those of the type <poflV|k> or
<k|V|pQ¢'>, where a’ is a state of the scatterer that has not too much
energy to be disallowed as a ﬁnal state by the law of conservation of
energy. These equations then reduce to

(W’—W)<PO¢'IH’> = <p@’lVl1<>><klH'>,

the a’ summation being over those values of a’ for which W’ given
by (I 8 )is > meg. These equations are now sufficiently simple for us
to be able to solve exactly without further approximation.

From the first of equations (4 6) we obtain by division

<P<>¢'IH'> = <Pw’IV|k><k|H'>/(W'—W)+?\5(W'— W)- (47)

We must choose Pl, which may be any function of the momentum
p and a’, such that (4 7 )represents the incident particles borresponding
to 10> or hlﬂpﬁoi”) together with only outward moving particles. [The
representative of hi |'p°a°> is actually of the form A3(W’—W), since
the conditions a’ = a" and p = p0 for it not to vanish lead to

W’ = E'--Hs(oc') = E’--fls(a“) m W" = W.] Thus (4 7)must be

It remains for us t0 determine the value of {is |H’>. We can do this
by substituting for <po¢'IH’> in the second of equations ( 4 6 )its value
given by (48). This gives

One can obtain the total effective area that the incident particle
must hit in order to be scattered anywhere by integrating (5 3) over
all directions of scattering, Le. by integrating over all directions of
the vector p’ with its magnitude kept ﬁxed at P’, and then summing
over all a’ that are to be taken into consideration, i.e. for which
W‘ > mce. This gives, with the help of (51), the result

If We suppose E’ to vary continuously through the value Ek, the
main variation of (5 3) or (54) will be due to the small denominator
(E’--E,,-~a)2+b2. If We neglect the dependence of the other factors
in (5 3)and (54) on E’, then the maximum scattering Will occur when
E’ has the value Ek-l-a and the scattering Will be half its maximum
when E differs from this value by an amount b. The large amount of
scattering that occurs for values of the energy of the incident particle
that make E’ nearly equal to Eh. give rise to the phenomenon of an
absorption line. The centre of the line is displaced by an amount

which would make the total energy just Ek, while the quantity b is
what is sometimes called the half-width of the line.
