#27. Schrodinger's form for the equations 0f motion

OUR work from § 5 onwards has all been'concerned with one instant
of time. It gave the general scheme 0f relations between states and
dynamical variables for a dynamical system at one instant of time.
To get a complete theory of dynamics we must consider also the
connexion between different instants of time. When one makes an
observation on the dynamical system, the state of the system gets
changed in an unpredictable way, but in between observations
causality applies, in quantum mechanics as in classical mechanics,
and the system is governed by equations of motion which make the
state at one time determine the state at a later time. These equations
of n1otion we now proceed to study. They will apply so long as the
dynamical system is left undisturbed by any observation or similar
pTOOEBSSIl‘ Their general form can be deduced from the principle of
superposition of Chapter I.

Let us consider a particular state of motion throughout the time
during which the system is left undisturbed. We shall have the state
at any time t corresponding to a certain ket which depends on t and
which nlay be written It). If we deal with several of these states of
motion we distinguish them by giving them labels such as A, and we
then write the ket which corresponds to the state at time t for one
of them IAIZ). The requirement that the state at one time determines
the state at another time means that lAtn) determines |At> except
for a numerical factor. The principle of superposition applies to these
states of motion throughout the time during which the system is
undisturbed, and means that if we take a superposition relation
holding for certain states at time to and giving rise to a linear equation
between the corresponding kets, e.g. the equation

|Rt0> == cl[At0>+c2]Bt0>,
the same superposition relation must hold between the states of

motion throughout the ti1ne during which the system is undisturbed
and must lead to the same equation between the kets corresponding
T The preparation of a state is a process of this kind. It often takes the form of

making an observation and selecting the system when the result of the observation
turns out to be a certain pre-assigned number.

the equation 1m) = clIAt>+C2|Bt>’

provided tlie arbitrary numerical factors By “Yhich these kets may be

. multiplied are suitably chosen. It follows that the [Ptfs are linear

functions of the [Ptoys and each {Pt} is the result of some linear
operator applied to IP60). In symbols

IP¢> = TIPQD, (1)
where T is a linear operator independent of P and depending only
on t (and to).

We now assume that each IP25) has the same length as the corre-
sponding {P50}. It is not necessarily possible to choose the arbitrary
numerical factors by which the |Pt)’s may be multiplied so as to
make this so without destroying the linear dependence of the |Pt>’s
on the |Pt0>’s. so the new assumption is a physical one and not just
a question of notation. It involves a kind of sharpening of the
principle of superposition. The arbitrariness in lPt) now becomes
merely a phase factor, which must be independent of P in order that
the linear dependence of the [PtYs on the |Pt0>’s may be preserved.
From the condition that the length of c1|Pt>+c2|Qt> equals that of
c1[Pt0>-[—c2[Qt0) for any complex numbers c1, c2, we can deduce that

<QiiP¢> = (QIFOIPHD- (9)

The conncxion between the |Pt>’s and |Pt0)’s is formally similar
to the connexion we had in§ 25 between the displaced and undisplaced
kets, with a process of time displacement instead of the space displace-
ment of § 25. Equations (l)and (2) play the part of equations (59)

and (60) of $25. We can develop the consequencesof these equations
as in § 25 and can deduce that T contains an arbitrary numerical

factor of modulus unity and satisfies
TT=L (3

correspondingto (62)of§ 25, so T is "aonitary. We pass to the infinitesi-
mal case by making t->- to and assume from physical continuity that

the limit

exists. This limit is just the derivative of {Pia} with respect to to.

From (1) it equals

110 THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION g2?

The limit operator occurring here is, like (64)of§ 25, a pure imaginary
linear operator and is undetermined to the extent of an arbitrary
additive pure imaginary number. Putting this limit operator multi-
plied by i??? equal to H, or rather H (to) since it may depend on to,
equation (4) becomes, when written for a general t,

dlPt> __
d1: _

Equation (5) gives the general law for the variation with time of
the ket corresponding to the state at any time. It is Sciaréidingeris-
form for the equations (f motion. It involves just one real linear
operator H(t), which must be characteristic of the dynamical system
under consideration. We assume that H (t) is the total energy (f
the system. There are two justifications for this assumption, (i) the
analogy with classical mechanics, which will be developed in the
next section, and (ii) we have HO?) appearing as He’, times an operator
of displacement in time similar to the operators of displacement in
the as, y, and z directions of § 25, so corresponding to (69) of § 25
we should have H05) equal to the total energy, since the theory of
relativity puts energy in the same relation to time as momentum to
distance.

We assume on physical grounds that the total energy of a system
is always an observable. For an isolated system it is a constant, and
may then be written H. Even when it is not a constant we shall often
write it simply H, leaving its dependence on t understood. If the
energy depends on t, it means the system is acted on by external
forces. An action of this kind is to be distinguished from a distur-
bance caused by a process of observation, as the former is compatible
with causality and equations of motion while the latter is not.

We can get a connexion between H (t) and the T of equation (l)
by substituting for IP25) in (5) its value given by equation (1). This
gives

Equation (5) now becomes

Equation (7) is known as Schrédingefs wave equation and its solutions
1,£¢(§t) are time-dependent wavefunctions. Each solution corresponds to

a state of motion of the system and the square of its modulus gives ‘

the probability of tlie Es having speciﬁed values at any time t. For
a system describable in terms of canonical coordinates and momenta
we may use Schrodinger's representation and can then take H to be
an operator of differentiation in accordance with (42) of § 22.
