#81. Interpretation

The foregoing work establishes the basic equations of quantum
electrodynamics. There are two forms of the theory, involving the
Hamiltonians H and H * respectively. We must now.consider the
interpretation and application of the theory. We shall take the H *
form for deﬁniteness. The argument would be essentially the same
with the H form.

The ket IQ) represents a state for which there are no photons,
electrons, or positrons present. One would be inclined to suppose this
state to be the perfect vacuum, but it cannot be, because it is not
stationary. For it to be stationary we should need to have

H*IQ> = CIQ>

with C a number. Now H* contains the terms

"el \5*l@<~@"¢* dawqhill  dawdgwa (118)

lX"-X’\

which do not give numerical factors when applied to |Q> and which
therefore spoil the stationary character of 1Q).

§81 DIFFICULTIES OF THE THEORY 307

Let us call the state Q represented by 1Q) the no-particle state at
a certain time. If we start with the no-particle state it does not remain
the no-particle state. Particles get created where none previously
existed, their energy coming from the interaction part of the Hamil-

tonian.
T0 study this spontaneous creation of particles, we take the ket

IQ) as initial ket in the Schrodinger picture and treat the terms (118)
as a perturbation giving rise to a probability of the state Q jumping
into another state, in accordance with the theory of § 44. The ﬁrst of
them, resolved into its Fourier components, contains a part

“amt If w’. ".21. ggp-i-kiidgkda . <119>

which causes transitions in which a photon is emitted and simul-
taneously an electron-positron pair is created. After a short time
the transition probability is proportional to the squared length of the
ket formed by multiplying (119) into the initial ket IQ), which is

Using the values of the P.B. and anticommutators given by (4), (16),
(72), (7 3), we get an integrand which depends on the k, k' variables
according to the law [k|"18(k--k’) for large values of k and k'. This
gives an integral that diverges, so the transition probability is inﬁnite.

The second term of (118), resolved into its Fourier components,
contains terms like ‘f;  L’:- ﬁﬂfwp», which cause transitions in which
two electron-positron pairs are created simultaneously. One can
calculate the transition probability as before, and one ﬁnds again
that it is inﬁnite. From these calculations one can conclude that the
state Q is not even approximately stationary.

A theory which gives rise to inﬁnite transition probabilities of
course cannot be correct. We can infer that there is something wrong
with quantum electrodynamics. This result need not surprise us,
because quantum electrodynamics does not provide a complete
description of nature. We know from experiment that there exist
other kinds of particles, which can get created when large amounts of

energy are available. All that we can expect from a theory of quantum

30s QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS § 81

electrodynamics is that it shall be valid for processes in which there
is not enough energy available for these other particles to be created
to an appreciable extent, say for energies up to a few hundred MeV.
Thus the high-energy part of the interaction energy (118) is quite
unreliable, and it is this high-energy part that is responsible for the
infinities.

It appears that we must modify the high-energy part of the inter-

action. At present there does not exist any detailed theory of the other
particles and so it is not possible to say how it ought to be modiﬁed.
The best we can do is to cut it out from the theory altogether, and so
remove the infinities. The precise form of the cut-off and the energy
‘Where it is applied will be left unspecified. Of course, the cut-off
spoils the relativistic invariance of the theory. This is a blemish
which cannot be avoided in our present state of ignorance of high-
energy processes.

Even with a cut-off the no-particle state Q is not approximately
stationary. It therefore-differs very much from the vacuum state.
The vacuum state must contain many particles, which may be
pictured as in a state of transient existence with violent ﬂuctua-
tions.

Let us introduce the ket IV) to represent the vacuum state. It is
the'eigenket of H* belonging to the lowest eigenvalue. Here and sub-
sequently H* denotes the expression (114) modified by the cut-off.
One might try to calculate IV) as a perturbation of the ket IQ), but
such a method would be of doubtful validity, because the difference
between IV) and IQ) is not small. No satisfactory way of calculating
IV) is known. In any case the result would depend strongly on the
cut-off, and since the cut-off is unspecified the result would not be a
definite one.

It follows that we must develop the theory without knowing IV).
This is not a great hardship, because we are not mainly interested in
the vacuum state. We are mainly interested in states which differ
from the vacuum through having a few particles present in addition
to those associated with the vacuum ﬂuctuations, and we want to
know how these extra particles behave. For this purpose we focus our
attention on an operator K representing the creation of the extra
particles, so that the state we are interested in appears as KJ V).

"We do not know how the ket IV) varies with the time in the Schro-
dinger picture, since we do not know the lowest eigenvalue of H*. ‘To

§31 DIFFICULTIES OF THE THEORY 309

avoid this difficulty we work in the Heisenberg picture in which I V) is
constant. We then require K I V) t0 represent another state in the
Heisenberg picture and thus t0 be another constant ket. This leads to

dK/dt = 0. (120)

Usually K will involve the time explicitly as well as Heisenberg
dynamical variables, so (120)gives

thaK/at-I-KH*-H*K = 0. (121)

We now have each physical state determined by a solution K of
(120)or (121). We obtained this result without knowing the vacuum
ket IV), and we can proceed to study K without knowing IV). The
only further information about K that we would have if we did know
IV) would be that two K's, say K1 and K2, would correspond to the
same state if we had (Kl-KQIV) = 0. But we can get on without
this further information and count all different K's satisfying ( 121 )
as corresponding to different states.

We are thus led to a drastic alteration of one of the basic ideas of
quantum mechanics, namely to represent a state by a linear operator and
not a ket vector. This alteration is brought about by the complexities
of applying quantum mechanics to a ﬁeld and by our ignorance of
high-energy processes.

A trivial solution of (120)or (121 ) is K = 1. This evidently corre-
sponds to the vacuum state.

A general solution may be put in the form of an explicit function of
t and of the dynamical variables at time t. Let us use the symbol v7,
to denote collectively the emission operators at time t. Thus m
equals one of the variables Mm, _* :9 at the time tin the Heisenberg

We require some physical interpretation for the state represented by
this K, as the usual physical interpretation of quantum mechanics,
requiring a state to be represented by a ket, is no longer applicable.
We shall need to make some new assumptions.

Keeping to the Heisenberg picture, we introduce at each time t the
ket IQQ satisfying the conditions (116) with respect to the Heisenberg
dynamical variables at time t. These conditions may now be written

“XIQO = 0-

The ket IQI) corresponds to no particles existing at the time t and it
provides a reference ket for the discussion of general states at time t.

310 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS §81

For any state fixed by a solution K of (l2l)we form K |Q,) and
assume that this ket determines what can be observed at the time t and is
t0 be interpreted according t0 the standard rules. We obtain K in the
form (122) and then arrange it so that in each term all the absorption
operators ~73", are to the right of all the emission operators 17,. It is then
said to be in the normal order. Any term in K containing an absorption
operator then contributes nothing to K |Q,). The surviving terms in
K] Q, ) will contain only emission operators, like (ll 7). Each surviving
term is associated with certain particles in particular states, and the
square of the modulus of its coefficient (with the appropriate factors
n ! when there is more than one boson in the same state) is assumed to
be, after normalization, the probability of these particles existing in
these particular states at the time t.

We now have a general method of physical interpretation which is
rather similar to the usual one, but there are important differences.
A term in K with an absorption operator on the right will not con-
tribute to KIQQ and so will not contribute anything observable at
time t. We may call it a latent term at the time t. Such a term cannot
be discarded as non-existent, because it will contribute observable
effects at other times. These latent terms are a new feature of the
theory and are to be understood as an incompleteness in the descrip-
tion of a state in terms merely of the particles which can be observed
to be present at a certain time.

As a consequence of the occurrence of latent terms, if K IQQ is
normalized at one time, it will usually not be normalized at other times.
We thus have to carry out a separate normalization for each time in
order to derive the probabilities.
