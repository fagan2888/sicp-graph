#53. Emission and absorption

For studying entiission and absorption we must consider non-
stationary states of the system and must use the perturbation method
of § 44. To determine the coefficient of spontaneous emission we must
take an initial state for which the particle is absorbed, corresponding
to a ket I70), and determine the probability that at some later time
the particle shall be on its way to inﬁnity with a deﬁnite momentum.
The method of§ 46 can now be applied. From the result (39) of that
section we see that the probability per unit time per unit range of w
and X, of the particle being emitted in any direction w’, X’ With the
scatterer being left in state a is

provided, of course, that a’ is such that the energy W’, given by (18),
of the particle is greater than mo? For values of a’ that do not satisfy
this condition there is no emission possible. The matrix element
< 'w’X’a']V]k> here must refer to a representation in which W, w, X,
and a are diagonal with the weight function unity. The matrix
elements of V appearing in the three preceding sections refer to a repre-
sentation in which pa, p”, p, are diagonal with the weight function
unity, or P, w, X are diagonal with the weight function P2sinw.
They would thus refer to a representation in which W, w, X are
diagonal with the weight function dP/dlV.P2SiI1w = WP/cZsinw.
Thus the matrix element (I 'w'X'oc']V[]c> in (55) is equal to
(W'P '/c2. sin w’? times our previous matrix element (W 'w’X’a’|V[Ic>
or <p’o¢"|V]k), so that (55)is equal to

The probability of emission per unit solid angle per unit time, with
the scatterer simultaneously dropping to state a’, is thus

To obtain the total probability per unit time of the particle being
emitted in any direction, with any final state for the scatterer, we

must integrate (56) over all angles w’, x’ and sum over all states a’
whose energy Ham’) is such that IQQKH-mcg < Ek. The result is
just Zb/ii, where b is deﬁned by (51). There is thus this simple rela-
tion between the total emission coeﬂicient and the half-width b 0f the
absorption line.

Let us now consider absorption. This requires that we shall take
an initial state for which the particle is certainly not absorbed but is
incident with a definite momentum. Thus the ket corresponding to
the initial state must be of the form (19). We must now determine
the probability of the particle being absorbed after time t. Since our
ﬁnal state h is not one of a continuous range, we cannot use directly
the result (39) of$46. If, however, we take

 i ipoao>s 
as the ket corresponding to the initial state, the analysis of §§ 44 and 46

is still applicableas far as equation (3 6)and shows us that the proba-
bility of the particle being absorbed into state h after time t is

2l<l<=lVlp°w°>igll*"°°S{(Et~—-E')#/5}]/(Ek—E32-
This corresponds to a distribution of incident particles of density
72:4, owing to the omission of the factor h? from (57), as compared
with (19). The probability of there being an absorption after time

t when there is one incident particle crossing unit area per unit time
is therefore
2h3W°/c2P°.|(klV|p°a°>{2[1~—cos{(Ek—E’)t/h}]/(E,,—E’)2- (58)
To obtain the absorption coefficient we must consider the incident
particles not all to have exactly the same energy W“ = E’—H3(°¢°)»
but to have a distribution of energy values about the correct value
Ek-Hga“) required for absorptidn. If we take a beam of incident
particles consisting of one crossing unit area per unit time per unit
energy range, the probability of there being an absorption after time
twill be given by the integral of (5 8)with respect to E '. This integral
may be evaluated in the same wvay as (3 7) of§ 46 and is equal to

The probability per unit time of an absorption taking place with an

incident beam of one particle per unit area per unit time per unit
energy range is therefore

which is the absorption coefficient.

206 COLLISION PROBLEMS §53

The connexion between the absorption and emission coefficients
(59) and (56) and the resonance scattering coefficients calculated in
the preceding section should be noted. When the incident beam does
not consist of particles all with the same energy, but consists of a unit
distribution of particles per unit energy range crossing unit area per
unit time, the total number of incident particles with energies near
an absorption line that get scattered will be given by the integral
of (54) with respect to E’. If one neglects the dependence of the
numerator of (54) on E’, this integral will, since

o0 b ’
j (E’—Ek—a)2+b2dE m T’

have just the value (59). Thus the total number J scattered particles
in the neighbourhood of an absorption line is equal to the total number
absorbed. We can therefore regard all these scattered particles as
absorbed particles that are subsequently re-emitted in a different
direction. Further, the number of particles in the neighbourhood of
the absorption line that get scattered per unit solid angle about a
given direction specified by p' and then belong to scatterers in state
a’ will be given by the integral with respect to E’ of (53), which
integral has in the same way the value

This is just equal to the absorption coefficient (59) multiplied by the
emission coefficient (56) divided by 2b Hi, the total emission coefficient.
This is in agreement with the point of view of regarding the resonance
scattered particles as those that are absorbed and then re-emitted,
with the absorption and emission processes governed independently
each by its own probability law, since this point of view would
make the fraction of the total number of absorbed particles that are
re-emitted in a unit solid angle about a given direction just the
emission coefficient for this direction divided by the total emission
coefficient.
