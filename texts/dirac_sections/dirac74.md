#74. The electromagnetic ﬁeld in the absence of matter

THE theory of radiation that was set up in Chapter X involved some
approximations in its handling of the interaction of the radiation
with matter. The object of the present chapter is to remove these
approximations and get, as far as possible, an accurate theory of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld interacting with matter, subject to the limitation
that the matter consists only of electrons and positrons. Too little is
known about other forms of matter, protons, neutrons, etc., for one
to attempt at the present time to get an accurate theory of their
interaction with the electromagnetic ﬁeld. But there exists a precise
theory of electrons and positrons, as given in the preceding chapter,
which one can use for building up a precise theory of the interaction
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld with this form of matter. The theory
must bring in the interaction of the electrons and positrons with one
another, through their Coulomb forces, as well as their interaction
with electromagnetic radiation, and it must, of course, conform to
special relativity. For brevity in this chapter we shall take c = l.

We must ﬁrst consider the electromagnetic ﬁeld without interaction
with matter. Now in § 63 we set up ﬁrst a treatment of the ﬁeld of
radiation without interaction of matter. Dynamical variables were
there introduced to describe the ﬁeld, commutation relations were
established for them, and a Hamiltonian was found which made them
vary correctly with the time. No approximations were made in this
piece of work. The resulting theory would therefore be a satisfactory,
exact theory of radiation without interaction with matter, were it not
for one feature in it, namely our taking the scalar potential to be zero.
This feature spoils the relativistic form of the theory and makes it
unsuitable as a starting-point from which to develop a precise theory
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in interaction with matter.

We must therefore extend the treatment of $63 by leaving A,
general and bringing it into the work along with the other potentials
A,, A,, A,. Thus we shall have the four A, and they will satisfy, as
the generalization of (62) of § 63,

53A,, = 0, aAp/aw, m o. (l), (B)
For the present we shall ignore the second of these equations.

§74= THE ELECTROJIAGNETIC FIELD 277

For the present we shall ignore the second of these equations and
Work only from the first.

Equation (1) shows that each A, can be resolved into waves
travelling with the velocity of light. Thus, corresponding to equation

where Ic.x denotes the four-dimensional scalar product
10.x = kQacO-(hx),
k1, being the 4-vector whose space components are the same as the
components of the three-dimensional vector k of $ 6 3 and whose time
component k0 = [k], and d3k denotes dial 62kg dies, as in § 63. The index
c in the coefficients Aflk indicates that they are constant in time. We
shall later introduce some other Fourier coefficients A)“, not constant
in time, which must be distinguished from the present ones.
The Fourier component Afm has a part A3,, coming from A0(:c) and
a part Aﬁk (r = 1, 2, 3) which is a three-dimensional vector. The latter
can be decomposed into two parts, a longitudinal part lying in the
direction of k, the direction of motion of the waves, and a transverse
part perpendicular to k. The longitudinal part is k, IcS/IcJKAQk. The
transverse'part is
(SrsTTkr 155/1502) 3k = ﬂgk» (4)
say. It satisfies krﬂfﬁk = O. (5)

It is known from the Maxwell theory of light that only the trans-
verse part is effective for giving electromagnetic radiation. Chapter X
dealt only with this transverse part, the Am of § 63 being the same as
the present d $1; and equation (6 5)of $ 63 corresponding to the present
equation (5). Nevertheless, the longitudinal part cannot be neglected
in a complete theory of electrodynamics because of its connexion
with the Coulomb forces, as will show up later.

We can now decompose the three-dimensional vector A,.(x) into

two parts, a transverse part and a longitudinal part. The former is
Wm) = f wskeik~w+ﬁskerik~x> 613k

and satisfies 8.sai,(as)/6a:,. = O. (5)

The longitudinal part may be expressed as the gradient 817/805,. of a
scalar V given by

V m i f ks/lc02.(A§keik-°=- A31. 6'15"“) m. ('1')
Thus A, = mﬁav/ax, (s)

The magnetic field is determined by the transverse part of A,,

It is convenient t0 count A0(x) as longitudinal, so that the complete
potentials A,,(x) are separated into a transverse part affix) and a
longitudinal part A,, ﬁV/ﬁx, This separation, of course, refers to a
particular Lorentz frame of reference.and must not be used when one
wants to keep one's equations in a relativistic form.

Each Fourier coefficient Aim occurs in (3) combined with the time

say, forms a Hamiltonian dynamical variable in classical mechanics
and a Heisenberg dynamical variable in quantum mechanics, like the
the A,,, of §63.

The work of § 63 gives us the P.B. relations for the transverse part
of A, To connect up with it, we pass over to discrete k-values in
three-dimensional k-space and take, for example, a particular discrete
k-value for which k1 = k2 = 0, k3 = k0 > 0. Then the polarization
variable 1 can take on two values referring to the two directions 1

and 2 and equation (7 3) of § 63 gives, with the help of the commutation
relations for the 17’s and is, equations (ll) of § 60,

[A-IIUJATRI] = [ZﬂuA-Qk] :‘_"7:8k/47T2k0' (10)

The work of § 63 gives us .no information about A3,, and A,,.
However, we can now obtain the P.B. relations for A3,, and A,,
from the theory of relativity. Equations (l()) have to be built up into
a relativistic set and the only simple way of doing so is by adding to

them the two further equations

M3.“ Ask] = aim“ A,,,] = _7;3k/4772k0: (1 1)
so that the four equations (l0) and (l1), together with the conditions

that EM, and A,, commute for p. # v (as they must do since they
refer to different degrees of freedom), combine to form the single

tensor equation [ EH1“ Ark] I 7; gpv 8k f 477216” (12)

We get'in this way the P.B. relations for all,the dynamical variables.
Equation (12) can be extended to

[Z1110 A 11K] Z igpv 8k skkJéqi-gkﬂ‘ (1 

Let us now return to continuous k-values. To convert 3W to con-

tinuous k-values we note that, for a general function f ( k )in three-
dimensional k-space,

where S(k—-k') is the three-dimensional 8 function
5(k—k') = 5W1-kl)5tkrké)5(ka—ké)-

In order that (14) may conform to the standard formula connecting
sums and integrals, equation (52) of § 62, we must have

8,5,“, = 5(k-k’). (15)
Thus ( 13) goes over to
[.l'1“,k,.4,,k.] = zgpyétwﬂk, . S(k-~k’). (16)
This equation, together with the equations
[Apl-PAVl-U] T“ [Anpksﬁvkll T: O) 

provide the P.B. relations in the theory with continuous k-values.
It should be noted that these P.B. relations remain valid if we replace

A,,, Auk by Aim, 15k. The same P.B. relations apply to the constant
Fourier coefficients AfLk, 3k.

We must now obtain a Hamiltonian which makes each dynamical
variable A,, vary with the time t = x0 in the Heisenberg picture

according to the law ( 9 )with Aft,‘ constant. Calling this Hamiltonian
HF, we require

[A,,, HF] = dApk/dxo = ikoA”. (18)
It is easily seen that this is satisfied by
HF = -4w2 f k,2.4,,,.I1"~k¢13k. (19)

We therefore take (19), with the possible addition of an arbitrary
numerical term not involving any dynamical variables, as the Hamil-
tonian for the electromagnetic field in the absence of matter.

In § 63 we used our knowledge of the transverse part of the Hamil-
tonian to obtain the P.B.s of the transverse variables. We have now
applied the reverse procedure to the longitudinal variables, using our
knowledge of their P.B.s, obtained by a relativistic argument, to
find the part of the Hamiltonian,that refers to them so as to get
agreement with (18).

If we write out the Hamiltonian (19) it ‘appears as

The first three terms of the integrand here have a transverse part
which is just equal t0 the transverse energy given by (71) of § 63.
The last term of the integrand, which is the part of HF referring t0
the scalar potential A,, appears with a minus sign. This nainus sign
is demanded by relativitv and means that the dynamical system
formed by the variables A,,, Zqk is a harmonzc oscillator cf negative
energy. It is rather surprising that such an unphysical idea as negative
energy should appear in the theory in this way. We shall see in § 77
that the negative energy associated with the degrees of freedom
connected with A, is always compensated by the positive energy
associated with the other longitudinal degrees of freedom, so that
it never shows up in practice.
