#35. Angular momentum

Let us consider a particle described by the three Cartesian coordi-
nates X, y, z and their conjugate momenta p,, p,, p,. Its angular
momentum about the origin is deﬁned as in the classical theory, by

ma, = 21212-2211, my = 2295-229. mg = wry-m.’ (22)

or by the vector equation
m = xxp.
We must evaluate the P.B.s of the angular momentum components
with the dynamical variables X, 1a,, etc., and with each other. This
We cam do most conveniently with the help of the laws (4) and (5) 0f
§ 21, thus

and similarly,

with corresponding relations for m, and m,. Again

(37)
[mpmm] = my, [mapmg] = ma.

These results are all the same as in the classical theory. The sign in
the results (23), (25), and (27) may easily be remembered from the
rule that the + sign occurs when the three dynamical variables, con-
sisting of the two in the P.B. on the left-hand sideand the one
forming the result on the right, are in the cyclic order (Xyz) and the
— sign occurs otherwise. Equations (27) may be put in the vector

“In m >< m. = 132m. (28)

Now suppose We have several particles with angular momenta
m1,m2,.... Each of these angular momentum vectors Will satisfy
(28), thus

m, x m, = 21713111,,
and any one of them will commute With any other, so that

m,.><ms+ms><m, = 0 (r ;é s).

§ 35 ANGULAR MOMENTUM 141

Hence if M = 2 m, is the total angular n1omentum,
T

MXM Z Zma-Xms Z Z mrXmr-i" Z (mrxms+ms><mr)
rs r r<s

= m; 2 m, = 01M. (29)

This result is of the same form as (28), so that the components of the
total angular momentum M of any number of particles satisfy the
same commutation relations as those of the angular momentum of
a single particle.

Let A,, A,, A, denote the three coordinates of any one of the
particles, or else the three components of momentum of one of
the particles. The A's will commute with the angular momenta of
the other particles, and hence from (23), (24), (25), and (26)

[llfmAm] = A,,, [lkfwAy] =—= -A,,, [M,,,A,] = 0. (30)

If Bx, By, B, are a second set of three quantities denoting the
coordinates or momentum components of one of the particles, they
will satisfy similar relations to (30). We shall then have

Thus the scalar product A, Bx-i-Ay By-I-A, B, commutes With M”
and similarly with Ma, and  Introduce the vector product

A >< B = G

A, B_,--A,B, = 0,, A_.,B,,--A_.,, B, = 0,, A, B,-A,B, = 0,.

and similarly [l\/I, Cy] = —C',,,, [ZVQCZ] = O.

These equations are again of the form (30), with C for A. We can
conclude from this Work that equations of the form (30) hold for the
three components of any vector that We can construct from our
dynamical variables, and that any scalar commutes With M.

We can introduce linear operators R referring to rotations about
the origin in the same Way in which We introduced the linear operators
D in § 25 referring to displacements. Taking a rotation through an

142 ELEMENTARY APPLICATIONS § 35

angle Sql about the z-axis and making 3gb inﬁnitesimal, we can obtain
the limit operator corresponding to (64) of § 25,
' _ I
gig‘) (R lli5¢>

which we shall call the rotation opera-tor about the z-axis and denote
by r5. Like the displacement operators, r, is a pure imaginary linear
operator and is undetermined to the extent of an arbitrary additive
pure imaginary number. Corresponding to (66) of § 25, the change
in any dynamical variable v caused by a rotation through a small
angle 895 about the z-axis is

Sglﬂrzvmvig), (31)
to the ﬁrst order in 89S. Now the changes produced in the three
components A,, A,, A, of a vector by a (right-handed) rotation 396
about the z-axis applied to all measuring apparatus are M514”,

~—8qSA_,,, and 0 respectively, and any scalar quantity is unchanged by
the rotation. Equating these changes to (31), are ﬁnd that

rzAm-Axrz = Ag, rzatly~Alurz 1: "Ax,
rzAz-Azrz = O,

and r, commutes with any scalar. Comparing these results with (30),
we see that ilirz satisﬁes the same commutation relations as M3.
Their difference, lI@--i?ir,,, commutes xvit-h all the dynamical variables
and must therefore be a number. This number, which is necessarily
real since M, and 21hr, are real, may be made zero by a suitable choice
of the arbitrary pure imaginary number that can be added to w‘, We
then have the result M = i%?_z_ (32)

Similar equations hold for llfx and lily. They are the analogues of (69)
of $25. Thus the total angular momentum is connected with the rota-
tion operators as the total momentum is connected with the displacement
operators. This conclusion is valid for any point as origin.

The above argument applies to the angular momentum arising
from the motion of particles, defined by (22) for each particle. There
is another kind of angular momentum occurring in atomic theory,
spin an guhr momentum. The former kind of angular momentum will
be called orbital angular momentum, to distinguish it. The spin angu-
lar momentum of a particle should be pictured as due to some internal
motion of the particle, so that it is associated with different degrees
of freedom from those describing the motion of the particle as a whole,

§35 ANGULAR MOMENTUM 143

and hence the dynamical variables that describe the spin must com-
mute with x, y, z, p,, p,, and p,. The spin does not correspond very
closely to anything in classical mechanics, so the method of classical
analogy is not suitable for studying it. However, we can build up a
theoryof the spin simply from the assumption that the components
of the spin angular nlomentum are connected with the rotation opera-
tors in the same way as we had above for orbital angular momentum,
i.e. equation (32) holds with M, as the z component of the spin angular
momentum of a particle and w, as the rotation operator about the
z-axis referring to states of spin of that particle. With this assump-
tion, the commutation relations connecting the components of the
spin angular momentum M with any vector A referring to the spin
must be of the standard form (30), and hence, taking A to be the
spin angular momentum itself, we have equation (29) holding also
for the spin. We now have (29) holding quite generally, for any sum
of spin and orbital angular momenta, and also (30) will hold generally,
for M the total spin and orbital angular momentum and A any vector
dynamical variable, and the connexion between angular momentum
and rotation operators will be always valid.

As an immediate consequence of this connexion, we can deduce the
lav cf conservation cf angular momentum. For an isolated system, the
Hamiltonian must be unchanged by any rotation about the origin, in
other words it must be a scalar, so it must commute with the angular
momentum about the origin. Thus the angular momentum is a
constant of the motion. For this argument the origin may be any
point.

As a second immediate consequence, we can deduce that a state
with zero total angular momentum is spherically symmetrical. The state
will correspond to a ket IS), say, satisfying

Mwl3> = BIyiS> = %|3> 2 l
and hence rx|S> = QIIS) = QIS) = 0.

This shows that the ket IS) is unaltered by inﬁrlitesimal rotations,
and it must therefore be unaltered by finite rotations, since the latter
can be built up from infinitesimal ones. Thus the state is spherically
symmetrical. The converse theorem, a spherically symmetrical state
has Zero total angular momentum, is also true, though its proof is not
quite so simple. A spherically symmetrical state corresponds to a ket
{S} whose direction is unaltered by any rotation. Thus the change

in IS) produced by a rotation operator rm, 91y, or r, must be a numerical
multiple of IS), say
Tm|S> = 6x115’), Tyls) = 6,13% Tz|S> = 651$,
Where the c's are numbers. This gives
Mx|S> = iﬁ¢xl5>, MAS) m iﬁvylsh .

1mm = was; (33)
These equations are not consistent With the commutation relations
(29) for M, My, M, unless 0,, = 0,, = o, = 0, in Which case the state
has zero total angular momentum. We have in (33) an example of
a ket Which is simultaneously an eigenket of the three non-commuting

linear operators Mm, My, 1%, and this is possible only if all three
eigenvalues are zero.
