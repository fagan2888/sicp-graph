#19. Theorems about functions of observables

We shall illustrate the mathematical value of representations by
using them to prove some theorems.

THEOREM 1. A linear operator that commutes with an observable 5
commutes also with any function cf f.

The theorem is obviously true when the function is expressible as

§l9 THEOREMS ABOUT FUNCTIONS 01*‘ OBSERVABLEG 77

a power series. To prove it generally, let w be the linear operator,
so that we have the equation

gw-wg = 0. (57)

Let us introduce a representation in which E is diagonal. If 5 by
itself does not form a complete commuting set of observables, we must
make itinto a complete commuting set by adding certain observables,
5 say, to it, and then take the representation in which {f and the 18%.
are diagonal. (The case when {I does form a complete commuting set
by itself can be looked upon as a special case of the preceding one
with the number of ﬁ variables zero.) In this representation equation

(57) becomes <g,ﬁ.-lgw_wglgn)8i,> = 0’
which reduces to
él<élﬁf|(uigffﬂfl>__<gfﬁfltulgﬂﬁrf>gﬂ i 
In the case when the eigenvalues of E are discrete, this equation
shows that all the matrix elements <§’B’|w]§",8"> of w vanish except

those for which 5’ = 5". In the case when the eigenvalues o ff are
continuous it shows, like equation (48), that <§',8'lw|§" ”> is of the

m“ <é’ﬁ'lwlé”ﬁ”> = c8<§*-s">.

where c is some function of E’ and the ,8”s and ﬁms. In either case
we may say that the matrix representing w ‘is diagonal with respect
to 5’. If f(§) denotes any function o ff in accordance with the general
theory of $1 1,which requiresf(§"’) to be defined for 5”’ any eigenvalue
of f, we can deduce in either case

f(§’)<<§’23'|<vl§”5">"—<§'l5'lwl§"5">f(§") = 0-
This gives <§’B'If(§)w—wf(§)]§”;8"> = 0,
so that f(§)w—wf(§) = 0

and the theorem is proved.

As a special case of the theorem, we have the result that any
observable that commutes with an observable § also commutes with
any function of 5. This result appears as a physical necessity when
we identify, as in §13, the condition of commutability of two
observables with the condition of compatibility of the correspond-
ing observations. Any observation that is compatible with the
measurement of an observable f must also be compatible with the
measurement of f(§), since any measurement of 5 includes in itself
a measurement of f(§).

THEOREM 2. A. linear operator that commutes with each of a complete
set cf commuting observables is a function cf those observables.

Let w be the linear operator and §1,§2,...,§,, the complete set of
commuting observables, and set up a representation with these
observables diagonal. Since w commutes with each of the Ks, the
matrix representing it is diagonal with respect to each of the §’s,
by the argument we had above. This matrix is therefore a diagonal
matrix and is of the form (49), involving a number c’ which is a
function of the ”s. It thus represents the function of the §’s that
c' is of the §”s, and hence w equals this function of the §’s.

THEOREM 3. Ifan observable E and a linear operator g are such that
any linear operator that commutes with 5 also commutes with g, then g
is a function cf 5.

This is the converse of Theorem 1. To prove it, we use the same
representation with f diagonal as we had for Theorem 1. In the first
place, we see that g must commute with 5 itself, and hence the
representative of g must be diagonal with respect to 5, i.e. it must
be of the form

<grﬁrlglgrtﬁrw> i “(grﬁrﬁnugérglr Or a(£1B:Brr)8(€r__ga-L
according to whether .5 has discrete or continuous eigenvalues. Now
let w be any linear operator that commutes with 5, so that its
representative is of the form
<gfﬁl’cuigffﬁlf> i b(gfﬁfﬁfl)séié'  b(gfﬁfﬁff)s(ffﬂﬂgif).
By hypothesis w must also commute with g, so that
<§'ﬁ'1gw-wg|§"s"> = 0» <58)
If we suppose for definiteness that the B’s have discrete eigenvalues,
(58)leads, with the help of the law of matrix multiplication, to
B2{a(grﬁrﬁlrr)b(grﬁrrlﬁrr)_b(giﬁlﬁiﬂ)a(grﬁlllﬁrl)} Z 0, 
the left-hand side of (58) being equal to the left-hand side of (59)

multiplied by 55,5» or 8(§’-§”). Equation (59) must hold for all
functions b(§',8’[3”). We can deduce that

w(£’B'B")= 0 for 5' #13”.
v axgrﬁrﬁ!) Z (“£1505”).
The first of these results shows that the matrix representing g is

diagonal and the second shows that a(§’{3’ﬁ”) is a function of 5' only.
We can now infer that g is that function off "which a(§’B',B') is off’,

so the theorem is proved. The proof is analogous if some of t h e ' s
have continuous eigenvalues.

Theorems 1 and 3 are still valid if we replace the observable E by
any set of commuting observables §1,§2,..,§,., only formal changes
being needed in the proofs.
