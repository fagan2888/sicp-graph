#70. Existence of the spin

In § 67 we saw that the correct wave equation for the electron in
the absence of an electromagnetic field, namely equation (7)or (10), is
equivalent to the wave equation (6) which is suggested from analogy

264 RELATIVISTIC THEORY OF THE ELECTRON §70

with the classical theory. This equivalence no longer holds when
there is a ﬁeld. The Wave equation to be expected from analogy with
the classical theory in this case is

in which the operator is just the classical relativistic Hamiltonian. If '

We multiply (11)by some--factor on the left to make it resemble
(30)as closely as possible, namely the factor

We now use the general formula that, if B and C are any two
three-dimensional vectors that commute with a,

(34)
This equation differs from (30) through having two extra terms in
the operator. These extra terms involve some new physical effects,
but since they are not real they do not lend themselves very directly
to physical interpretation.

To get an understanding of the physical features involved in the
difference between (34) and (30)it is better to WOFk with the Heisen-
berg picture, this picture being always the more suitable one for
comparisons between classical and quantum mechanics. The Heisen-
berg equations of motion are determined by the Hamiltonian

with the help of (33). We have here the real part of the extra terms
in (34) appearing without the pure imaginary part. For an electron
moving slowly (i.e. with small momentum), we may expect the
Heisenberg equations of motion to be determined by a Hamiltonian
of the form mc2+H1, where H1 is small compared with mcZ. Putting
mcZ-J-Hl for H in (36) and neglecting H? and other terms involving

The Hamiltonian H1 given'by (37) is the same as the classical
Hamiltonian for a slow electron, except for thk last term

This term may be considered as an additional potential energy

which a slow electron has in the quantum theory and may be
interpreted as arising from the electron having a magnetic moment
—?£e/2m.c.o'. This magnetic moment is the one assumed in §§ 41 and
47 for dealing with the Zeeman effect and is in agreement with
experiment.

The spin angular momentum does not give rise to any potential
energy and therefore does not appear in the result of the preceding
calcillation. The simplest Way of showing the existence of the spin
angular momentum is to take the case of the motion ofa free electron
or an electron in a central ﬁeld of force and determine the angular
momentum integrals. This means Working with the Hamiltonian (23),
or with the Hamiltonian (35) with A = 0 and A, a function of the

and obtaining the Heisenberg equations of motion for the angular
momentum. With either Hamiltonian We find for the rate of change

Thus vial qé 0 and the orbital angular momentum is not a constant
of the motion. This result is to be expected from the integrated
equation of motion (29), the oscillatory part of the motion here dis-

played giving rise to an oscillatory term in the angular momentum.

so that the vector m-k-g-Fics is a constant of the motion. This result
one can interpret by saying the electron has a spin angular momentum

éﬂicr, which must be added to the orbital angular momentum n1 before
one gets a constant of the motion. The spin angular momentum

could alternatively be obtained from the rotation operators for states
of spin in accordance with the general method of $35.

The same vector c ﬁxes the directions of both the spin magnetic
moment and the spin angular momentum. If an electron in a certain
state of spin has a spin angular momentum of  in a particular
direction, it will have a magnetic moment ~—eh/2mc in the same
direction.

We were led to the value e572} for the spin of the electron by an
argument depending simply on general principles of quantum theory
and relativity. One could apply the same argument to other kinds
of elementary particle and one would be led to the same conclusion,
that the spin angular momentum is half a quantum. This woulcl be
satisfactory for the proton and the neutron, but there are some kinds
of elementary particle (eg. the photon and certain kinds of meson)
whose spins are known experimentally to be different from 5t, so we
have a discrepancy between our theory and experiment.

The answer is to be found in a hidden assumption in our work.
Our argument is valid only provided the position of the particle is
an observable. If this assumption holds, the particle must have a
spin angular momentum of half a quantum. For those particles that
have a different spin the assumption must be false and any dynamical
variables x1, x,, x3 that may be introduced to describe the position
of the particle cannot be observables in accordance with our general
theory. For such particles there is no true Schrodinger representation.
One might be able to introduce a quasi wave function involving the
dynamical variables x1, x,, x3, but it would not have the correct
physical interpretation of a wave function—that the square of its
modulus gives the probability density. For such particles there is still
a momentum representation, which is sufficient for practical purposes.
