#50. Solution with the momentum representation

The result (15) for the scattering coefficient makes a reference only
to that representation in which the momentum p is diagonal. One
would thus expect to be able to get a more direct proof of the result
by working all the time in the p-representation, instead of working
in the x-representation and transforming at the end to the p-repre-
sentation, as was done in § 49. This would not at first sight appear
to be a great improvement, as the lack of directness of the x-repre-
sentation method is offset by more direct applicability, it being
possible to picture the square of the modulus of the X-representative
of a state as the density of a stream of particles in process of being
scattered. The x-representation method has, however, other more
serious disadvantages. One of the main applications of the theory
of collisions is to the case of photons as .incident particles. Now a
photon is not a simple particle but has a polarization. It is evident
from classical electromagnetic theory that a photon with a definite
momentum, i.e. one moving in a definite direction with a definite
frequency, may have a definite state of polarization (linear, circular,
etc.), while a photon with a definite position, which is to be pictured
as an electromagnetic disturbance confined to a very small volume,
cannot have any definite polarization. These facts mean that the
polarization observable of a photon commutes with its momentum
but not with its position. This results in the p-representation method
being immediately applicable to the case of photons, it being only
necessary to introduce the polarizing variable into the representatives
and treat it along with the afs describing the scatterer, while the

 

194 COLLISION PROBLEMS §50

x-representation method is not applicable. Further, in dealing with
photons, it is necessary to take relativistic mechanics into account.
This can easily be done in the p-representation method, but not so
easily in the x-representation n1ethod.

Equation (3) still holds with relativistic mechanics, but W is 110W

a definite function of p,, 391,403 given by (16). This may be written

where W’ = E'--Hs(oa') (18)

and is the energy required by the law of conservation of energy for

and equation (17) may be written
(W’~—W)<Pw’l1> = h*<P@=1'|V|P°@¢°>- (20)

We now make a transformation from the Cartesian coordinates
pa, 39y, pz of p to its polar coordinates P, w, X, given by

pa, = PGOSw, pa, = Psinw cos X, p5 = Psinw sin X.

If in the new representation we take the weight function P2 sin w,
then the ureight attached to any volume of p-space will be the same
as in the previous p-representation, so that the transformation will
mean simply a relabelling of the rows and columns of the matrices
without any alteration of the matrix elements. Thus (20) will become
in the new representation

(Wp-WXPQJXQKII) = h3<PwXof|V|PUw°X°oz°>, (21)

W being now a function of the single variable P.

§5O SOLUTION WITH MOMENTUM REPRESENTATION 195

The coefficient of (Pwxaafll), namely Wi-W, is now simply a
multiplying factor and not a differential operator as it was with the
x-representation method. We can therefore divide out by this factor
and obtain an explicit expression for (Pwxaﬂl). When, however, a’
is such that W’, defined by (18), is greater than mcz, this factor will
have the value zero for a certain point in the domain of the variable
P, namely the point P = P’, given in terms of W’ by (I 6). The
function (Pwxcfll) will then have a singularity at this point. This
singularity shows that (Pa) X0111) represents an infinite number of
particles moving about at great distances from the scatterers with
energies indefinitely close to W’ and it is therefore this singularity
that we have to study to get the angular distribution of the particles

at infinity.
The result of dividing out (2 l) by the factor W'—--W is, according

to (13) of§ l5,

(Pwxofﬂ) := h‘3'<PwXcx’[V[P0w°X°o¢°>/( W'— IV)—]—A(wXa') 3( W'— W),
(22)

where A is an arbitrary function of w, X, and a’. To give a meaning
to the first term on the right-hand side of (22), we make the conven-
tion that its integral with respect to P over a range that includes the
value P’ is the limit when e+O of the integral when the small
domain Pﬂ-e to P’—f—e is excluded from the range of integration.
This is sufficient to make the meaning of (22) precise, since we are
interested effectively only in the integrals of the representatives of
states when the representation has continuous ranges of rows and
columns. We see that equation (2 I )is inadequate to determine the
representative (PUJXQKII) completely, on account of the arbitrary
function A occurring in (22). We must choose this A such that
(Pwxofjl) represents only outward moving particles, since we want,
the only inward moving particles to be those corresponding to I0).

Let us take first the general case when the representative (Pwx!)
of a state of the particle satisfies an equation of the type

(W’—W)<Pwxl>=f(1’wx)= (93)

where f(PwX) is any function of P, w, and X, and W’ is a number
greater than mcz, so that (Pwxl) is of the form

<Pwxl> = f(Pwx)/( W’—- WH-Pdwx) 5( W“- W), (24)

and let us determine now what A must be in order that (Pwxl) may

represent only outward moving particles. We can do this by trans-
forming <Pcux|> t0 the X-representation, 0r rather the (rﬁqﬂ-repre-
sentation, and comparing it with (12) for large values of r. The

which formula holds since f K(P)e*'iP’lﬁ dP is of order 6-1 for any

g<P>/<P'-~P>-g(P'>/(P'-P>

neglect of terms involving W1, and also with neglect of the small
domain P’—-e to P‘+.-_= in the domain of integration, gives

which has the limiting value when P = P’,

Substituting this in (2 9)and adding on the expression (27), we obtain
the following value for the integral (26)

iris-gem‘ W'{——1Tf(P'1rX) +iA(wX)}e"*3P”m. (30)

Similarly the second term in the integrand in (2 5) gives
h*'%c-2r*1W’{--w f(P'0X)--':IA(0X)}e'iP”/ﬁ. (31)
The sum of these two expressions is the value of (¢0<i5|> when r is

large.

We require that <r0q5|> shall represent only outward moving
particles, and hence it must be of the form of a multiple of eilyrl”.
Thus (30)must vanish, so that \_

We see in this way that the condition that (r6951) shall represent
only outward moving particles in the direction 6 = G fixes the value
of A for the opposite direction 6 = n. Since the direction 6 = 0 or
w = 0 of the pole of our polar coordinates is not in any way singular,
we can generalize (32) to

which gives the value of A for an arbitrary direction. This value
substituted in (2 4) gives a result that may be written

<Pwx|> =f(Pwx){1/(W'—ll’)-ie3(W'— Wl), (34)

since one can substitute P’ for P in the coefficient of a term involving
3(W’—W) as a factor without changing the value of the term. The

condition that (Pwxl) shall represent only outward moving particles is
thas that it shall contain the factor

{1/(W’--W)-iw aura W) ) . (35)

It is interesting to note that this factor is of the form of the right-
hand side of equation (l 5) of § 15.

With A given by (33), expression (30) vanishes and the value of
(r0951) for large r is given by expression (3 l) alone, thus

(r0q5|> --= ——2wh"1'0"2r*1W‘f(P’OX)e°‘5P"lﬁ.
This may be generalized to
(rﬁqtj) = —21rh“i’(3“2?’"1Wtf(P’coX)3iP'Tlﬁ,

giving the value of (rdgbl) for any direction 9, g5 in terms of f(P'wX)
for the same direction labelled by w, X. This is of the form ( l 2 )with

and thus represents a distribution of outward moving particles of
momentum P’ whose number is

cZP’ 41r2W’P’ ,
per unit solid angle per unit time. This distribution is the one
represented by the (Pond) of (34).

From this general result we can infer that, whenever we have a
representative <PcoXI> representing only outward moving particles
and satisfying an equation of the type (23), the number per unit solid
angle per unit time of these particles is given by (3 6).lf this (Pwpd)
occurs in a problem in which the number of incident particles is one
per unit volume, it will correspond to a scattering coefficient of
amount

It is only the value of the function f(PwX) for the point P = P’ that
is of importance.

If we now apply this general theory t0 our equations (21) and
(22), we have

f(PwX) = YJ/KPwXQKII/IPOQJOXOQH’).

If one neglects relativity and puts WOWYQ‘ = m2, this result reduces
to the result (15) obtained in the preceding section by means of

Green's theorem.
