#43. The change in the energy-levels caused by a perturbation

The ﬁrst of the above-mentioned methods will now be applied to
the calculation of the changes in the energy-levels of a system caused
by a perturbation. We assume the perturbing energy, like the Hamil-
tonian for the unperturbed system, not to involve the time explicitly.
Our problem has a meaning, of course, only provided the energy-levels
of the unperturbed system are discrete and the differences between
them are large compared with the changes in them caused by the
perturbation. This circumstance results in the treatment of perturba-
tion problems by the first method having some different features

according to whether the energy-levels of the unperturbed system are
discrete or continuous.

Let the Hamiltonian of the perturbed system be

H = E —|- V, (l)
E being the Hamiltonian of the unperturbed system and V the small
perturbing energy. By hypothesis each eigenvalue H‘ of H lies very
close to one and only one eigenvalue E’ of E. We shall use the same
number of primes to specify any eigenvalue of H and the eigenvalue
of E to which it lies very close. Thus we shall have H" differingfrom
E" by a small quantity of order V and differingfrom E’ by a quantity
that is not small unless E‘ = E”. We must now take care always to

§43 CHANGE IN THE ENERGY-LEVELS 169

use different numbers of primes to specify eigenvalues of H and E

Which We do not Want to lie very close together.
T0 obtain the eigenvalues of H, We have to solve the equation

H[H’>_= H'|H’>
or (H’-E)]H’> = V|H’>. (2)
Let 10> be an eigenket of E belonging to the eigenvalue E ' and

suppose,the 1H’) and H’ that satisfy (2) to differ from i0) and E’
only by small quantities and to be expressed as

|H'> = l0>+l1>+l3>+---, J (3)
H’ = E ’fa1+a2+...,
Where l1) and a, are of the first order of smallness (Le. the same order
as V), 12> and a, are of the second order, and so on. Substituting
these expressions in (2), We obtain

{E"-E+a1+a2+...}{[0>+|1)+}2>-|-...} = V{]0>+]1)+...}.
If We now separate the terms of zero order, of the first order, of the
second order, and so on, We get the following set of equations,

(E’“'E)l1>+a1l0> = VIOZ (4)
(E"'“E)|2>+a1|1>+a2l0>= 711%

The first of these equations tells us, What We have already assumed,
that l0) is an eigenket of E belongingto the eigenvalue E ’. The others

enable us to calculate the various corrections {l}, |2>,..., a,, a2,“ .
For the further discussion of these equations it is convenient to

introduce a representation in which E is diagonal, i.e. a Heisenberg
representation for the unperturbed system, and to take E itself as
one of the observables Whose eigenvalues label the representatives.
Let the others, in the event of others being necessary, as is the case
When there is more than one eigenstate of E belonging to any eigen-
value, be called Fs. A basic bra is then <E",8"|. Since |0> is an

eigenket of E belonging to the eigenvalue E ', We have

<E”ﬁ”l0> = 5E'E'f (18% (5)
WherefQB”) is some function of the variables ,8". With the help of this
result the second of equations (4), Written in terms of representatives,
becomes

(E"—~E”)<E"5”l1>+@15E-E'f(»8") = Z <E"B"IVIE'B’>J‘°(5’)- (6)

Putting E" = E’ here, we get

Equation ( 7 )is of the form of the standard equation in the theory
of eigenvalues, so far as the variables )3’ are concerned. It shows that
the various possible values for a, are the eigenvalues of the matrix
<E';8"[V]E’,8'>. This matrix is a part of the representative of the
perturbing energy in the Heisenberg representation for the unper-
turbed system, namely, the part consisting of those elements that
refer to the same unperturbed energy-level E’ for their row and
column. Each of these values for a, gives, to the first order, an energy-
level of the perturbed system lying close to the energy-level E’ of the
unperturbed systemj There may thus be several energy-levels of the
perturbed system lying close to the one energy-level E’ of the unper-
turbed system, their number being anything not exceeding the
number of independent states of the unperturbed system belonging
to the energy-level E’. In this way the perturbation may cause a
separation or partial separation of the energy-levels that coincide
at E’ for the unperturbed system.

Equation (7) also determines, to the zero order, the representatives
(E”,8”|0> of the stationary states of the perturbed system belonging
to energy-levels lying close to E’, any solution fQB’) of ( 7) substituted
in (5) giving one such representative. Each of these stationary states
of the perturbed system approximates to one of the stationary states
of the unperturbed system, but the converse, that each stationary
state of the unperturbed system approximates to one of the stationary
states of the perturbed system, is not true, since the general
stationary state of the unperturbed system belonging to the energy-
level E’ is represented by the right-hand side of ( 5 )with an arbitrary
function fQB”). The problem of finding which stationary states of
the unperturbed system approximate to stationary states of the
perturbed system, i.e. the problem of finding the solutions ﬂﬁ’) of
(7), corresponds to the problem of ‘secular perturbations’ in classical
mechanics. It should be noted that the above results are indepen-
dent of the values of all those matrix elements of the perturbing

T To distinguish these energy-levels one from another We should require some
more elaborate notation, since according to the present notation they must all be
speciﬁed by the same number of primes, namely by the number of primes specifying

the energy-level of the unperturbed system from which they arise. Por our present
purposes, however, this more elaborate notation is not required.

energy which refer t0 two different energy-levels 0f the unperturbed
system.

Let us see What the above results become in the specially simple case
when there is only one stationary state of the unperturbed system
belonging to each energy-levelff In this case E alone ﬁxes the repre-
sentation, no f3’s being required. The sum in (7) now reduces to a
single term and We get

d, = (EWVIF) (8)
There is only one energy-level of the perturbed system lying close to
any energy-level of the unperturbed system and the change in energy
is equal, i n the ﬁrst order, to the corresponding diagonal element q’ the
perturbing energy i n the Heisenberg representation for the unperturbed
system, or to the average value q’ the perturbing energy for the correspond-
ing unperturbed state. The latter formulation of the result is the same
as in classical mechanics When the unperturbed system is multiply
periodic.

We shall proceed to calculate the second-order correction a, in
the energy-level for the case when the unperturbed system is non-
degenerate. Equation (5) for this case reads

<Eillo> 2 321E’: _
With neglect of an unimportant numerical factor, and equation (6)
reads (E’—E”)(E”|1>+a18E-E, = <E”[V|E’>.
This gives us the value of ( E|1> when E 5r‘: E’, namely
f! <E"|V|E’>
E = —---- 9

The third of equations (4), written in terms of representatives,
becomes
(E:_Err)<E1r|2>+a1<Enr!1>+a28Ew I z:  <EulViErxr><Enrtl>.
Putting E = E’ here, We get
a1<Eri1>+a2 i: g! <Er[V|Errr><Er.v‘1>’

which reduces, With the help of (8), to

a2: 2 <E'|V[E">(E"]1>.

called non-degenerate and one With tWo or more stationary states belonging to an
