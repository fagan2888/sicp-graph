#48. General remarks

IN this chapter We shall investigate problems connected With a par-
ticle Which, coming from inﬁnity, encounters or ‘collides With’ some
atomic system and, after being scattered through a certain angle, goes
off to inﬁnity again. The atomic system Which does the scattering
We shall call, for brevity, the scatterer. We thus have a dynamical
system composed of an incident particle and a scatterer interacting
with each other, Which We must deal With according to the laws of
quantum mechanics, and for Which We must, in particular, calculate
the probability of scattering through any given angle. The scatterer
is usually assumed to be of inﬁnite mass and to be at rest throughout
the scattering process. The problem was ﬁrst solved by Born by a
method substantially equivalent to that of the next section. We must
take into account the possibility that the scatterer, considered as a
system by itself, may have a number of different stationary states
and that if it is initially in one of these states when the particle arrives
from inﬁnity, it may be left in a different one when the particle goes
off to in. nity again. The colliding particle may thus induce transi-
tions in the scatterer.

The Hamiltonian for the Whole system of scatterer plus particle
will not involve the time explicitly, so that this Whole system will
have stationary states represented by periodic solutions of Schro-
dinger's Wave equation. The meaning of these stationary states
requires a little care to be properly understood. It is evident that
for any state of motion of the system the particle Will spend nearly all
its time at inﬁnity, so that the time average of the probability of the
particle being in any ﬁnite volume will be zero. Now for a stationary
state the probability of the particle being in a given ﬁnite volume,
like any other result of observation, must be independent of the time,
and hence this probability will equal its time average, Which We have
seen is zero. Thus only the relative probabilities of the particle being
in different ﬁnite volumes will be physically signiﬁcant, their absolute
values being all zero. The total energy of the system has a continuous
range of eigenvalues, since the initial energy of the particle can be
anything. Thus a ket, ls) say, corresponding to a stationary state,

being an eigenket of the total energy, must be of inﬁnite length. We
can see a physical reason for this, since if 1s) were normalized and if
Q denotes that observable—a certain function of the position of
the particle—that is equal to unity if the particle is in a given ﬁnite
volume and zero otherwise, then <s|Q|.s-) would be zero, meaning that
the average value of Q, i.e. the probability of the particle being in the
given volume, is zero. Such a ket Is) would not be a convenient one
to work with. However, with 1s) of inﬁnite length, <s]Q|.s) can be
ﬁnite and would then give the relative probability of the particle
being in the given volume.

In picturing a state of a system corresponding to a ket |:v) which
is not normalized, but for which (xlx) = n say, it may be convenient
to suppose that we have n similar systems all occupying the same
space but with no interaction between them, so that each one follows
out its own motion independently of the others, as we had in the
theory of the Gibbs ensemble in § 33. We can then interpret <x|a|x),
where o: is any observable, directly as the total o: for all the n systems.
In applying these ideas to the above-mentioned 1s) of inﬁnite length,
corresponding to a stationary state of the system of scatterer plus
colliding particle, we should picture an inﬁnite number of such sys-
tems with the scatterers all located at the same point and the particles
distributed continuously throughout space. The number of particles
in a given finite volume would be pictured as (slQls), Q being the
observable deﬁned above, which has the value unity when the particle
is in the given volume and zero otherwise. If the ket is represented
by a Schrodinger wave function involving the Cartesian coordinates
of the particle, then the square of the modulus of the wave function
could be interpreted directly as the density of particles in the picture.
One must remember, however, that each 0f these particles has its own
individual scatterer. Different particles may belong to scatterers in
different states. There will thus be one particle density for each state
of the scatterer, namely the density of those particles belonging to
scatterers in that state. This is taken account of by the wave function
involving variables describing the state of the scatterer in addition
to those describing the position of the particle.

For determining scattering coefﬁcients we have to investigate
stationary states of the whole system of scatterer plus particle. For
instance, if we want to determine the probability of scattering in
various directions when the scatterer is initially in a given stationary

§48 GENERAL REMARKS 187

state and the incident particle has initially a given velocity in a given
direction, we must investigate that stationary state of the whole
system whose picture, according to the above method, contains at
great distances from the point of location of the scatterers only
particles moving with the given initial velocity and direction and
belonging each to a scatterer in the given initial stationary state,
together with particles moving oatzaard from the point of location
of the scatterers and belonging possibly to scatterers in various
stationary states. This picture corresponds closelyto the actual state
of affairsin an experimental determination of scattering coefficients,
with the difference that the picture really describes only one actual
system of scatterer plus particle. The distribution of outward moving
particles at infinity in the picture gives us immediately all the infor-
mation about scattering coefficients that could be obtained by experi-
ment. For practical calculations about the stationary state described
by this picture one may use a perturbation method somewhat like
that of § 43, taking as unperturbed system, for example, that for
which there is no interaction between the scatterer and particle.

In dealing with collision problems, a further possibility to be taken
into consideration is that the scatterer may perhaps be capable of
absorbing and re-emitting the particle. This possibility arises when
there exists one or more states 0f absorption of the whole system, a
state of absorption being an approximately stationary state which
is closed in the sense mentioned at the end of § 38 (Le. for which
the probability of the particle being at a greater distance than r from
the scatterer tends to zero as r -> oo). Since a state of absorption is
only approximately stationary, its property of being closed will be
only a transient one, and after a sufficient lapse of time there will be
a ﬁnite probability of the particle being on its way to infinity.
Physically this means there is a finite probability of spontaneous
emission of the particle. The fact that we had to use the word
‘approximately’ in stating the conditions required for the phenomena
of emission and absorption to be able to occur shows that these condi-
tions are not expressible in exact mathematical language. One can give
a meaning to thesephenomena. only with reference to a perturbation
method. They occur when the unperturbed system (of scatterer plus
particle) has stationary states that are closed. The introduction of the
perturbation spoils the stationary property of these states and gives
rise to spontaneous emission and its converse absorption.

188 COLLISION PROBLEMS § 48

For calculating absorption and emission probabilities it is necessary
t0 deal with non-stationary states of the system, in contradistinction
t0 the case for scattering coefficients, so that the perturbation method
of § 44 must be used. Thus for calculating an emission coefﬁcient
we must consider the non-stationary states of absorption described
above. Again, since an absorption is always followed by a re-emission,
it cannot be distinguished from a scattering in any experiment in-
volving a steady state of affairs, corresponding to a stationary state
of the system. The distinction can be made only by reference to a
non-steady state of affairs, eg. by use of a stream of incident particles
that has a sharp beginning, so that the scattered particles will appear
immediately after the incident particles meet the scatterers, while
those that have been absorbed and re-emitted will begin to appear
only some time later. This stream of particles would be the picture
of a certain ket of inﬁnite length, which could be used for calculating
the absorption coefﬁcient.
