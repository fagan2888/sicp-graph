#28. Heisenberg's form for the equations 0f motion

In the preceding section we set up a picture of the states of
undisturbed motion by making each of them correspond to a moving
ket, the state at any time corresponding to the ket at that time. We
shall call this the Schrédelnger picture. Let us apply to our kets the
unitary transformation which makes each ket la) go over into

la*) = T-1l@>- (3)

This transformation is of the form given by (75) of § 26 with T "1 for
U, but it depends on the time t since T depends on t. It is thus to be
pictured as the application of a continuous motion (consisting of
rotations and uniform deformations) to the whole ket vector space.
A ket which is originally ﬁxed becomes a moving one, its motion being
given by (8) with |a> independent of t. On the other hand, a ket
which is originally moving to correspond to a state of undisturbed
motion, i..e. in accordance with equation (l), becomes fixed, since on
substituting |Pt) for la) in (8) we get la*) independent of t. Thus
the transformation brings the kets corresponding to states cf undisturbed
motion to rest.

The unitary transformation must be applied also to bras and linear
operators, in order that equations between the various quantities may
remain invariant. The transformation applied to bras is given by the
conjugate imaginary of (8) and applied to linear operators it is given
by (70) of § 26 with T-l for U, i.e.

3* = TdocT. (9)

112 THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION §2s

A linear operator Which is originally ﬁxed transforms into a moving
linear operator in general. Now a dynamical variable corresponds to
a linear operator which is originally fixed (because it does not refer
to t at all), so after the transformation it corresponds to a moving
linear operator. The transformation thus leads us to a new picture
of the motion, in Which the states correspond to fixed vectors and
the dynamical variables to moving linear operators. We shall call
this the Heisenberg picture.

The physical condition of the dynarnical system at any time
inyolves the relation of the dynamical variables to the state, and
the change of the physical condition With time may be ascribed
either to a change in the state, With the dynamical variables kept
fixed, which gives us the Schrodinger picture, or to a change in the
dynamical variables, With the state kept ﬁxed, Which gives us the
Heisenberg picture.

In the Heisenberg picture there are equations of motion for the
dynamical variables. Take a dynamical variable corresponding to
the fixed linear operator v in the Schrodinger picture. In the Heisen-
berg picture it corresponds to a moving linear operator, Which We
Write as v, instead of v*, to bring out its dependence on t, and Which

is given by U: = T__12)T (19)

Equation (11) 0r (13) shows hoW any dynamical variable varies
With time in the Heisenberg picture and gives us Heisenberg's form
for the equations of motion. These equations of motion are determined
by the one linear operator H], Which is just the transform of the linear
operator H occurring in Schr6dinger’s form for the equations of
motion and corresponds to the energy in the Heisenberg picture. We
shall call the dynamical variables in the Heisenberg picture, Where
they vary With the time, Heisenberg dynamical variables, to distinguish
them from the ﬁxed dynamical variables of the Schrodinger picture,
Which We shall call Schrodinger dynamical variables. Each Heisenberg
dynamical variable is connected With the corresponding Schrodinger
dynamical variable by equation (10). Since this connexion is a unitary
transformation, all algebraic and functional relationships are the
same for both kinds of dynamical variable. We have T = 1 for
t === to, so that w,“ = v and any Heisenberg dynamical variable at time
to equals the corresponding Schrodinger dynamical variable.

Equation (13) can be compared With classical mechanics, Where We
also have dynamical variables varying with the time. The equations
of motion of classical mechanics can be Written in the Hamiltonian

Where the g’s and 329s are a set of canonical coordinates and momenta

With the classical definition of a P.B., equation (1) of § 21. This is
of the same form as equation (13) in the quantum theory. We thus
get an analogy between the classical equations of motion in the
Hamiltonian form and the quantum equations of motion in Heisen-
berg's form. This analogy provides a justification for the assumption

114 THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION §28

that the linear operator H introduced in the preceding section is the
energy of the system in quantum mechanics.

In classical mechanics a dynamical system is deﬁned mathemati-
cally when the Hamiltonian is given, i.e. when the energy is given
in terms of a set of canonical coordinates and momenta, as this is
sufﬁcient to ﬁx the equations of motion. In quantum mechanics a

~ dynamical system is deﬁned mathematically when the energy is

given in terms of dynamical variables whose commutation relations
are known, as this is then sufﬁcient to ﬁx the equations of motion,
in both Schrodinger's and Heisenberg's form. We need to have
either H expressed in terms of the Schrodinger dynamical variables
or H} expressed in terms of the corresponding Heisenberg dynamical
variables, the functional relationship being, of course, the same in
both cases. We call the energy expressed in this way the Hamiltonian
of the dynamical system in quantum mechanics, to keep up the
analogy with the classical theory.

A system in'quantum mechanics always has a Hamiltonian, whether
the system is one that has a classical analogue and is describable in
terms of canonical coordinates and momenta or not. However, if the
system does have a classical analogue, its connexion with classical
mechanics is specially close and one can usually assume that the
Hamiltonian is the same function of the canonical coordinates and
momenta in the quantum theory as in the classical theoryf? There
would be a diiﬁculty in this, of course, if the classical Hamiltonian
involved a product of factors whose quantum analogues do not com-
mute, as one would not know in which order to put these factors in
the quantum Hamiltonian, but this does not happen for most of the
elementary dynamical systems whose study is important for atomic
physics. In consequence we are able also largely to use the same
language for describing dynamical systems in the quantum theory as
in the classical theory (e.g. to talk about particles xvith given masses
moving through given ﬁelds of force), and when given a system in
classical mechanics, can usually give a meaning to ‘the same’ system
in quantum mechanics.

Equation (13) holds for v, any function of the Heisenberg dynamical
variables not involving the time explicitly, i.e. for v any constant

1' This assumption is found in practice to be successful only when applied with the
dynamical coordinates and momenta referring to a Cartesian system of axes and not
to more general curvilinear coordinates.

linear operator in the Schrodinger picture. It shows that such a
function w, is constant if it commutes with H, or if v commutes with H.
We then have v‘ = Uta = V’

and we call u, or u a constant 0f the motion. It is necessary that v shall
commute with H at all times, which is usually possible only if H is
constant. In this case we can substitute H for v in (13) and deduce
that H; is constant, showing that H itself is then a constant of the
motion. Thus if the Hamiltonian is constant in the Schrodinger
picture, it is also constant in the Heisenberg picture.

For an isolated system, a system not acted on by any external
forces, there are always certain constants of the motion. One of these
is the total energy or Hamiltonian. Others are provided by the
displacement theory of § 25. It is evident physically that the total
energy must remain unchanged if all the dynamical variables are
displaced in a certain way, so equation (63) of § 25 must hold with
ad = v s: H. Thus D commutes with H and is a constant of the
motion. Passing to the case of an infinitesimal displacement, we see
that the displacement operators dx, dy, and d, are constants of the
motion and hence, from (69) of § 25, the total Inomentum is a constant
of the motion. Again, the total energy must remain unchanged if all
the dynamical variables are subjected to a certain rotation. This
leads, as will be shown in § 35, to the result that the total angular
momentum is a constant of the motion. The laws of conservation of
energy, momentum, ana’ angular momentum hola’ for an isolated system
in the Heisenberg picture in quantum mechanics, as they hola’ in
classical mechanics.

Two forms for the equations of motion of quantum mechanics have
now been given. Of these, the Schrodinger form is the more useful
one for practical problems, as it provides the simpler equations. The
unknowns in Schrodinger's wave equation are the numbers which
form the representative of a ket vector, while Heisenberg's equation
of motion for a dynamical variable, if expressed in terms of a repre-
sentation, would involve as unknowns the numbers forming the
representative of the dynamical variable. The latter are far more
numerous and therefore more djﬁicult to evaluate than the Schro-
dinger unknowns. Heisenberg‘s form for the equations of motion is
of value in providing an immediate analogy with classical mechanics
and enabling one to see how various features of classical theory, such

116 THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION §28

as the conservation laws referred to above, are translated into quan-
tum theory.
