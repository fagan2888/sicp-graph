#42. General remarks
IN the preceding chapter exact treatments were given of some simple
dynamical systems in the quantum theory. Most quantum problems,
however, cannot be solved exactly with the present resources of
mathematics, as they lead to equations whose solutions cannot be
expressed in finite terms with the help of the ordinary functions of
analysis. For such problems one can often use a perturbation method.
This consists in splitting up the Hamiltonian into two parts, one of
which must be simple and the other small. The first part may then
be considered as the Hamiltonian of a simplified or unperturbed
system, which can be dealt with exactly, and the addition of the
second will then require small corrections, of the nature of a perturba-
tion, in the solution for the unperturbed system. The requirement
that the first part shall be simple requires in practice that it shall not
involve the time explicitly. If the second part contains a small
numerical factor e, we can obtain the solution of our equations for
the perturbed system in the form of a power series in e, which, pro-
vided it converges, will give the answer to our problem with any
desired accuracy. Even when the series does not converge, the first
approximation obtained by means of it is usually fairly accurate.
There are two distinct methods in perturbation theory. In one of
these the perturbation is considered as causing a modiﬁcation o‘ the
states o‘ motion of the unperturbed system. In the other we do not
consider any modification to be made in the states of the unperturbed
system, but we suppose that the perturbed system, instead of remain-
ing permanently in one of these states, is continually changing from
one to another, or making transitions, under the inﬂuence of ‘the
perturbation. Which method is to be used in any particular case
depends on the nature of the problem to be solved. The first method
is usefulusually only when the perturbing energy (the correction in the
Hamiltonian for the undisturbed system) does not involve the time
explicitly, and is then applied to the stationary states. It can be used
for calculating things that do not? refer to any deﬁnite time, such as
the energy-levels of the stationary states of the perturbed system, or,
in the case of collision problems, the probability of scattering through

a given angle. The second method must, on the other hand, be used
for solving all problems involving a consideration of time, such as
those about the transient phenomena that occur when the perturba-
tion is suddenly applied, or more generally problems in which the
perturbation varies with the time in any way (Le. in which the per-
turbing energy involves the time explicitly). Again, this second
method must be used in collision problems, even though the per-
turbing energy does not here involve the time explicitly, if one
wishes to calculate absorption and emission probabilities, since these
probabilities, unlike a scattering probability, cannot be deﬁned with-
out reference to a state of affairs that varies with the time.

One can summarize the distinctive features of the two methods by
saying that, with the first method, one compares the stationary states
of the perturbed system with those of the unperturbed system; with
the second method one takes a stationary state of the unperturbed

system and sees how it varies with time under the inﬂuence of the
perturbation.
