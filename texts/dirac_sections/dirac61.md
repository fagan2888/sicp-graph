#61. Emission and absorption of bosons

Let us suppose that the oscillators of the preceding section are
harmonic oscillators and there is no interaction between them. The
energy of the ath oscillator is then, from (5)of § 34,

Ha = ﬁwa 77a ﬁa+éﬁwa°
We shall neglect the constant term 3-1ﬂiwa, which is the energy of the
oscillator in its lowest state—the so-called ‘zero-point energy’. This
neglect does not have any dynamical consequences, as explained at

the beginning of § 30, and merely involves a redefinition of Ha. The
total energy of all the oscillators is now

With the help of (I2). This is of the same form as (10), With iiwa for
H“. Thus a set 0f barf/tonic osciliators is equivalent to an assembly of
bosons in stationary states with no interaction between them. If an
oscillator of the set is in its n'th quantum state, there are n’ bosons in
the associated boson state.

In general the Hamiltonian for the set of oscillators will be a power
series in the variables ha, 5a, say

HT z: HP+ 2 (UaqiaTiT Uaﬁai-l” l; (Uab naﬁb+gzb7ia7ib+lzbﬁaﬁbi+~w

(40)
Where HP, U“, Uab, 171,, are numbers, HP being real and Uab = ma. If
the set of oscillators are in interaction with an atom, as We had at
the end of the preceding section, the total Hamiltonian will still be
of the form (40), With H , If“, Uab, IQ, functions of the atom variables,
HP in particular being ths Hamiltonian for the atom by itself. A
general treatment of this dynamical system Would be rather compli-
cated and for practical applications one assumes that the terms

HP+ 2 Uaa Haﬁz: (41)

are large compared With the others and form by themselves an
unperturbed system, the remaining terms being taken into account
as a perturbation producing transitions in the unperturbed system,
according to the theory of § 44. If, further, Um is independent of the
atom variables, the unperturbed system with Hamiltonian (41) con-
sists merely of an atom with Hamiltonian HP and an assembly of
bosons in stationary states with Hainiltonian of the form (39), with
no interaction.

Let us consider What kinds of transitions are produced by the
various perturbation terms in (40). Take a stationary state of the
unperturbed system for which the atom is in a stationary state, Z’ say,

and bosons are present in the stationary boson states, a, b, 0,... . This
stationary state for the unperturbed system corresponds to the ket
Tia 71b 7lc'"iO>iC!>> 

like (37). If the term U; 1% of (4 0) is multiplied into this ket, the
result is a Iinear combination of kets like

"71: 71a 77b 770'" io>gﬁ>s 

ﬁ" denoting any stationztry state of the atom. The ket (4 3) refers to
one more boson than the ket (42), the extra boson being in the states.

Thus the perturbation term Um 17,, gives rise t0 transitions in which
one boson is emitted into state x and the atom. makes an arbitrary
jump. If the term ﬁx ﬁx of (40) is multiplied into r42), the result is

referring to one boson less in state x. Thus the perturbation term
‘(Ta ﬁx gives rise to transitions in which one boson is absorbed from
state x, the atom again making an arbitrary jump. Similarly, we ﬁnd
that a perturbation term U,” 17,, 5,, (X ¢ y) gives rise to processes in
which a boson is absorbed fIOHl state y and one is emitted into state
x, or, what is the same thing physically, one boson makes a transition
from state y to state x. This kind of process would be produced by
a term like the UT of (22) and (29) in the perturbation energy, pro-
vided the diagonal elements (a) U|a> vanish. Again, the perturbation
terms Véy 17,, n”, T7,,” ﬁx '51, give rise to processes in which two bosons are
eniitted or absorbed, and so on for more complicated terms. With

any of these emission and absorption processes the atom can make.

an arbitrary jump.
Let us determine how the probability of occurrence of each of these

. transition processes depends on the numbers of bosons originally

present in the various boson states. From §§ 44, 46 the transition
probability is always proportional to the square of the modulus of
the matrix element of the perturbation energy referring to the two
states concerned. Thus the probability of a boson being emitted into
state x with the atom making a jump from state Q’ to state C” is
proportional to

I<€”I<n1né~(n;+1)--ll7$ nan; n;~n;.-->rc’>|% <44)
the n”s being the numbers of bosons initially present in the various
boson states. Now from (6) and (17), with reference to (4),

so that nxln;  = (n25)- 1)1*\n1n§..(n;+1)..>. (46)

Hence ( 4 4 )is equal to
(n-Z¢+1)l<§”lUe|§’>|2> (47)

showing that the probability of a transition in which a hoson is emitted
into state x is proportional to the number of bosons originally in stale x
plus one.

§51 EMISSION AND ABSORPTION OF BOSONS 235

The probability of a boson being absorbed from state a: with the
atom making a jump from state §’ to state ‘C’ is proportional to

|<:"|<n1n;~<n;.-1)~1Zﬁ..|n;n;~n;~>|@'>|2. <48)
the n”s again being the numbers of bosons initially present in the

5,171,; nf,..n;,..) = n.;§;n;n;..(n;,-1)..), (49)
so (48)is equal to '”'§;|<§"lUx|§’>|2~ (50)

Thus the probability cf a transition in which a boson is absorbed from
state X is proportional to the number of hosons originally in state x.
Similar methods may be applied to more complicated processes,
and show that the probability of a process in which a boson makes
a transition from state 3/ to state x (a: 7k y) is proportional to aging-H).
More generally, the probability of a process in which bosons are
absorbed from states X, y,... and emitted into states a, b,... is propor-

the n”s being in each case the numbers of bosons originally present.
These results hold both for direct transition processes and transition

processes that take place through one or more intermediate states,
in accordance with the interpretation given at the end of $44.
