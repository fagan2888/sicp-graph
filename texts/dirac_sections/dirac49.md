#49. The scattering coefﬁcient

We shall now consider the calculation of scattering coefﬁcients,
taking first the case when there is no absorption and emission, which
means that our unperturbed system has no closed stationary states.
We may conveniently take this unperturbed system to be that for
which there is no interaction between the scatterer and particle. Its
Hamiltonian will thus be of the form

E = H,+ W, (1)

where H, is that for the scatterer alone and W that for the particle
alone, namely, with neglect of relativistic mechanics,

W = I/Zmtpi-i-pi-l-pﬁ). (2)
The perturbing energy V, assumed small, will now be a function of
the Cartesian coordinates of the particle x, y, z, and also, perhaps,
of its momenta p,, p,,, p,, together with dynamical variables describ-
ing the scatterer.

Since ‘we are now interested only in stationary states of the whole
system, we use a perturbation method like that of $43. Our unper-
turbed system now‘ necessarily has a continuous range of energy-
levels, since it contains a free particle, and this gives rise to certain
modificationsin the perturbation method. The question of the change
in the energy-levels caused by the perturbation, which was the main

§49 THE SCATTEEING COEFFICIENT 189

question of § 43, no longer has a meaning, and the convention in § 43
of using the same number of primes to denote nearly equal eigen-
values of E and H now drops out. Again, the splitting of energy-
levels which we had in§ 43 when the unperturbed system is degenerate
cannot now arise, since if the unperturbed system is degenerate the
perturbed one, which must also have a contiriuous range of energy-
levels, will also be degenerate to exactly the same extent.

We again use the general scheme of equations developed at the
beginning of § 43, equations (l) to (4) there, but we now take our
unperturbed stationary state forming the zero-order approximation
to belong to an energy-level E’ just equal to the energy-level H’ of
our perturbed stationary state. Thus the a's introduced in the second
of equations (3)§ 43 are now all zero and the second of equations

(4) there now reads (E,___E)|1> H: mo) (3)

Similarly, the third of equations (4)§ 43 now reads
(E'—E)]2> = V|1>. (4)

We shall proceed to solve equation (3) and to obtain the scattering
coefficient to the ﬁrst order. We shall need equation (4) in §5l.

Let o: denote a complete set of commuting observables describing
the scatterer, which are constants of the motion when the scatterer is
alone and may thus be used for labelling the stationary states of the
scatterer. This requires that HS shall commute with the a's and be
a function of them. We can now take a representation of the whole
system in which the 03s and x, y, z, the coordinates of the particle,
are diagonal. This will make H3 diagonal. Let l0) be represented by
(x0410) and 11> by (Xe/ll), the single variable x being written to
denote x, y, z and the prime being omitted from x for brevity. Also
the single differential d3x will be written to denote the product dxdydz.
Equation (3), written in terms of representatives, becomes,with the
help of (l)and (2),

Suppose that the incident particle has the momentum p" and that
the initial stationary state of the scatterer is a“. The stationary state

of our unperturbed system is now the one for which p = p" and
o: = e50, and hence its representative is

(x0510) =-_- 3a,’, ez<p'=.x>hs_ (6)

E‘ = ft<ow>+p°gﬂm~ (w)

Our problem now is to obtain a solution (Xe/II) of (7) which, for
values of X, y, z denoting points far from the scatterer, represents
only outward moving particles. The square of its modulus, Kxu’ ll) [2,
will then give the density of scattered particles belonging to scatterers
in the state a’ when the density of the incident particles is |<X<x°|0>|2,

which is unity. If we transform to polar coordinates 1*, 6, g6, equation
(7) becomes

Now F must tend to zero as r -—>- oo, on account of the physical re-
quirement that the interaction energy between the scatterer and

particle must tend to zero as the distance between them tends to
inﬁnity. If we neglect F in (l l)altogether, an approximate solution

for large r is Qacibofll) = u(6q5a,),__16.,;;,,, (12)

where u is an arbitrary function of 6, g8, and a’, since this expression
substituted in the left-hand side of (l l) gives a result of order P3.
When we do not neglect F , the solution of (ll) will still be of the
form (l2) for large v", provided F tends to zero sufficiently rapidly as
r --> co, but the function u will now be definite and determined by the
solution for smaller values of r.

For values a' of the 08s such that k2, deﬁned by (8), is positive, the
k in (l2) must be chosen to be the positive square root of k2, in order
that (12) may represent only outward moving particles, Le. particles
for which the radial component of momentum, which from § 38
equals p,.—-'i%o~-1 or -i%(8/6r+r*1), has a positive value. We now
have that the density of scattered particles belonging to scatterers in
state a', equal to the square of the modulus of (12), falls olf with
increasing r according to the inverse square law, as is physically

Further, the magnitude, P’ say, of the momentum of these scattered
particles must equal 10%, the momentum ‘being radial for large r,
so that their energy is equal to

With the help of (8) and (10). This is just the energy of an incident
particle, namely p°2/2m, reduced by the increase in energy of the
scatterer, namely Hs(o¢’)—Hs(a");' in agreement With the law of con-
servation of energy. For values a' of the a's such that k2 is negative
there are no scattered particles, the total initial energy being insuffi-
cient for the scatterer to be left in the state a’.

We must now evaluate uwqﬁa’) for a set of values a’ for the 03s such
that E2 is positive, and obtain the angular distribution of the scattered
particles belonging to scatterers in state a‘. It is sufficient to evaluate
u for the direction B = 0 of the pole of the polar coordinates, since
this direction is arbitrary. We make use of Green's theorem, Which
states that for any two functions of position A and B the ivolume
integral  (AV2B—BV2A)d3srr taken over any volume equals the
surface integral J (Aﬁlﬁ/ﬁnﬂﬁﬁAftm) as taken over the boundary
of the volume, 8/671, denoting differentiation along the normal to
the surface. We take

When one makes a transformation from the coordinates X to the
momenta p of the particle, using the transformation function (54)

components of momentum.

The density of scattered particles belonging to scatterers in state
a‘ is noW given by |u(9'gl>'oz')|2/T2. Since their velocity is P’/m, the
rate at Which these particles appear per unit solid angle about the
direction of the vector p' will be P’/m. |u(6’qf>’a’)|2. The density of
the incident particles is, as We have seen, unity, so that the number
of incident particles crossing unit area per unit time is equal to their
velocity PO/m, Where P“ is the magnitude of p”. Hence the effective
area that must be hit by an incident particle in order to be scattered

This is the scattering coefficient for transitions 010+ a’ of the scatterer.
It depends on that matrix element <p’a’lVlp°oi°> of the perturbing
energy V whose column p°a° and whose row phi’ refer respectively to
the initial and final states of the unperturbed system, between which
the (scattering transition process takes place. The result (15) is thus
in some ways analogous to the result (24) of § 44, although the
numerical coefficients are different in the two cases, corresponding
to the different natures of the two transition processes.
