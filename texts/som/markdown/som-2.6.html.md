*2.6* confusion
---------------

It's mainly when our other systems start to fail that we engage the
special agencies involved with what we call *consciousness.*
Accordingly, we're more aware of simple processes that don't work well
than of complex ones that work flawlessly. This means that we cannot
trust our offhand judgments about which of the things we do are simple,
and which require complicated machinery. Most times, each portion of the
mind can only sense how quietly the other portions do their jobs.
