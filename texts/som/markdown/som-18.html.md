*18* reasoning
==============

> Machines—with their irrefutable logic, their cold preciseness of
> figures, their tireless, utterly exact observation, their absolute
> knowledge of mathematics—they could elaborate any idea, however simple
> its beginning, and reach the conclusion. From any three facts they
> even then could have built in mind all the Universe. Machines had
> imagination of the ideal sort. They had the ability to construct a
> necessary future result from a present fact. But Man had imagination
> of a different kind, theirs was the illogical, brilliant imagination
> that sees the future result vaguely, without knowing the why, nor the
> how, and imagination that outstrips the machine in its preciseness.
> Man might reach the conclusion more swiftly, but the machine always
> reached the conclusion eventually, and it was always the correct
> conclusion. By leaps and bounds man advanced. By steady, irresistible
> steps the machine marched forward. —John W. Campbell, Jr.
