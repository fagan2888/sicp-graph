*18.3* chaining
---------------

Why is chaining so important? Because, as we've just seen, it seems to
work in many different realms. More than that, it can also work in
several ways at once, inside the same world. Consider how, with no
apparent mental strain at all, we can first imagine the same kind of
arch to be a bridge, a tunnel, or a table â€” and then we can imagine
chains of these, according to quite different views:

Chaining seems to permeate not only how we reason, but how we think of
structures in space and time. We find ourselves involved with chains
whenever we imagine or explain. Why does the ability to build mental
chains help us solve so many different kinds of problems? Perhaps
because all sorts of chains share common properties like these:

When chains are stressed, the weakest links break first. To fix a broken
chain, one needs to repair only its broken links. No part of a chain can
be removed if both ends remain fixed. If pulling A makes B move, there
must be a chain connecting A and B.

Each separate rule seems common sense, at least when we apply it to a
solid thing like a bridge, a fence, or a physical chain. But why do
chains apply so well to insubstantial *lines of thought*? It is because
there's such a good analogy between how chains can break and how
reasoning can fail.
