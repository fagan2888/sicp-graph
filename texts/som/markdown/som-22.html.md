> Henri finally came to the conclusion that the book owed its success
> simply to minsunderstandings. Lambert believed he had meant to exalt
> individualism through collective action, and Lechaume, on the other
> hand, believed it preached the sacrifice of the individual to
> collectivism. Everyone emphasized the book's moral character. And yet
> Henri…had thought of a man and of a situation, of a certain
> relationship between that man's past life and the crisis through which
> he was passing, and of a great many other things which none of the
> critics had mentioned. Was it his fault or the readers'? The public,
> Henri was forced to conclude, had liked a completely different book
> from the one he believed he was offering them. —Simone de Beauvior
