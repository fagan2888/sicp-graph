*17* development
================

> To the child, Nature gives various means of rectifying any mistakes he
> may commit respecting the salutary or hurtful qualities of the objects
> which surround him. On every occasion his judgments are corrected by
> experience; want and pain are the necessary consequences arising from
> false judgment; gratification and pleasure are produced by judging
> aright. Under such masters, we cannot fail to become well informed;
> and we soon learn to reason justly, when want and pain are the
> necessary consequences of a contrary conduct.\
> \
> In the study and practice of the sciences it is quite different; the
> false judgments we form neither affect our existence nor our welfare;
> and we are not forced by any physical necessity to correct them.
> Imagination, on the contrary, which is ever wandering beyond the
> bounds of truth, joined to self-love and that self-confidence we are
> so apt to indulge, prompt us to draw conclusions which are not
> immediately derived from facts… —A. Lavoisier
