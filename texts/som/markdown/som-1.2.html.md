How could solid-seeming brains support such ghostly things as thoughts?
This question troubled many thinkers of the past. The world of thoughts
and the world of things appeared to be too far apart to interact in any
way. So long as thoughts seemed so utterly different from everything
else, there seemed to be no place to start.

A few centuries ago it seemed equally impossible to explain Life,
because living things appeared to be so different from anything else.
Plants seemed to grow from nothing. Animals could move and learn. Both
could reproduce themselves — while nothing else could do such things.
But then that awesome gap began to close. Every living thing was found
to be composed of smaller cells, and cells turned out to be composed of
complex but comprehensible chemicals. Soon it was found that plants did
not create any substance at all but simply extracted most of their
material from gases in the air. Mysteriously pulsing hearts turned out
to be no more than mechanical pumps, composed of networks of muscle
cells. But it was not until the present century that John von Neumann
showed theoretically how cell-machines could reproduce while, almost
independently, James Watson and Francis Crick discovered how each cell
actually makes copies of its own hereditary code. No longer does an
educated person have to seek any special, vital force to animate each
living thing.

Similarly, a century ago, we had essentially no way to start to explain
how thinking works. Then psychologists like Sigmund Freud and Jean
Piaget produced their theories about child development. Somewhat later,
on the mechanical side, mathematicians like Kurt Gödel and Alan Turing
began to reveal the hitherto unknown range of what machines could be
made to do. These two streams of thought began to merge only in the
1940s, when Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts began to show how machines
might be made to see, reason, and remember. Research in the modern
science of Artificial Intelligence started only in the 1950s, stimulated
by the invention of modern computers. This inspired a flood of new ideas
about how machines could do what only minds had done previously.

Most people still believe that no machine could ever be conscious, or
feel ambition, jealousy, humor, or have any other mental
life-experience. To be sure, we are still far from being able to create
machines that do all the things people do. But this only means that we
need better theories about how thinking works. This book will show how
the tiny machines that we'll call *agents of the mind* could be the long
sought *particles* that those theories need.
