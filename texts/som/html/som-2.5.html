    <p>
      In the late 1960s Builder was embodied in the form of a computer program
      at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Both my collaborator,
      Seymour Papert, and I had long desired to combine a mechanical hand, a
      television eye, and a computer into a robot that could build with
      children&#39;s building-blocks. It took several years for us and our
      students to develop Move, See, Grasp, and hundreds of other little
      programs we needed to make a working Builder-agency. I like to think
      that this project gave us glimpses of what happens inside certain parts
      of children&#39;s minds when they learn to <em>play</em> with simple
      toys.  The project left us wondering if even a thousand microskills
      would be enough to enable a child to fill a pail with sand. It was this
      body of experience, more than anything we&#39;d learned about
      psychology, that led us to many ideas about societies of mind.</p>

    <p>
      To do those first experiments, we had to build a mechanical Hand,
      equipped with sensors for pressure and touch at its fingertips. Then we
      had to interface a television camera with our computer and write
      programs with which that Eye could discern the edges of the
      building-blocks. It also had to recognize the Hand itself. When those
      programs didn&#39;t work so well, we added more programs that used the
      fingers&#39; feeling-sense to verify that things were where they
      visually seemed to be. Yet other programs were needed to enable the
      computer to move the Hand from place to place while using the eye to see
      that there was nothing in its way. We also had to write higher-level
      programs that the robot could use for planning what to do &mdash; and
      still more programs to make sure that those plans were actually carried
      out. To make this all work reliably, we needed programs to verify at
      every step (again by using Eye and Hand) that what had been planned
      inside the mind did actually take place outside &mdash; or else to
      correct the mistakes that occurred.</p>

    <p>
      In attempting to make our robot work, we found that many everyday
      problems were much more complicated than the sorts of problems, puzzles,
      and games adults consider hard. At every point, in that world of blocks,
      when we were forced to look more carefully than usual, we found an
      unexpected universe of complications. Consider just the seemingly simple
      problem of not reusing blocks already built into the tower. To a person,
      this seems simple common sense: <em>Don&#39;t use an object to satisfy a
        new goal if that object is already involved in accomplishing a prior
        goal.</em> No one knows exactly how human minds do this. Clearly we
      learn from experience to recognize the situations in which difficulties
      are likely to occur, and when we&#39;re older we learn to plan ahead to
      avoid such conflicts. But since we cannot be sure what will work, we
      must learn policies for dealing with uncertainty.  Which strategies are
      best to try, and which will avoid the worst mistakes? Thousands and,
      perhaps, millions of little processes must be involved in how we
      anticipate, imagine, plan, predict, and prevent &mdash; and yet all this
      proceeds so automatically that we regard it as
      <em>ordinary common sense.</em> But if thinking is so complicated, what
      makes it seem so simple? At first it may seem incredible that our minds
      could use such intricate machinery and yet be unaware of it.</p>

    <p>
      In general, we&#39;re least aware of what our minds do best.</p>
