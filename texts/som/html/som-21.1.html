    <h2><em>21.1</em> the pronouns of the mind</h2>


    <p>
      We often say what we want to say in fewer words than might seem
      possible.</p>

    <p>
      <em>Do you see the table over there?</em> <em>Yes.</em>
      <em>Do you see the red block on it?</em> <em>Yes.</em>
      <em>Good. Please bring it to me.</em></p>

    <p>
      That first <em>it</em> saves the speaker from having to say <em>that
	table</em> again.  The second <em>it</em> does the same for <em>the
	red block.</em> Accordingly, many people consider a pronoun
      like <em>it</em> to be an abbreviation or substitute for another
      phrase used recently. But when we look at this more carefully, we
      see that a pronoun need not refer to any phrase at all.  For
      instance, the word <em>this</em> in the previous sentence was not an
      abbreviation for any particular phrase. Instead, it served as a
      signal to you, the reader, to examine more carefully a certain
      partial state of mind &mdash; in this case, a certain theory about
      pronouns &mdash; that I assumed was aroused in your mind by the
      sentences that preceded it. In other words, pronouns do not signify
      objects or words; instead, they represent conceptions, ideas, or
      activities that the speaker assumes are going on inside the
      listener&#39;s mind. But how can the listener tell which one of the
      activities is signified when there are several possibilities?</p>

    <p>
      <em>Do you remember the ring Jane liked?</em> <em>Yes.</em>
      <em>Good. Please buy it and give it to her.</em></p>

    <p>
      How do we know that <em>her</em> means Jane and that <em>it</em>
      means the ring &mdash; and not the other way around? We can tell
      that <em>her</em> is not the ring because English grammar usually
      restricts the pronoun <em>her</em> to apply only to a female person
      &mdash; though it could also mean an animal, a country, or a
      ship. But you would know that <em>it</em> means <em>the ring</em> in
      any case, because your Buy agency would not accept the thought of
      buying Jane, nor would your agency for Give accept the thought of
      giving gifts to rings. If someone said, <em>Buy Jane and give her to
	that ring,</em> both Buy and Give would have such strong conflicts
      that the problem would ascend to the listener&#39;s higher-level
      agencies, which would react with disbelief.</p>

    <p>
      Our language often uses pronounlike words to refer to mental
      activities &mdash; but we do not do this only in language: it
      happens in all the other higher-level functions of our minds. Later
      we&#39;ll see how Find will find a block &mdash; rather than, say, a
      toy giraffe &mdash; even though Builder has only said <em>find.</em>
      The trick is that Find will use whichever description happens to be
      available in its current context. Since it&#39;s already working for
      Builder, its subagents will assume that it should find a
      building-block.</p>

    <p>
      Whenever we talk or think, we use pronounlike devices to exploit
      whatever mental activities have already been aroused, to interlink
      the thoughts already active in the mind. To do this, though, we need
      to have machinery we can use as temporary <em>handles</em> for
      taking hold of, and moving around, those active fragments of mental
      states. To emphasize the analogy with the pronouns of our languages,
      I&#39;ll call such handles <em>pronomes.</em> The next few sections
      speculate about how pronomes work.</p>
