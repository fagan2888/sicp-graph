<h2><em>17.7</em> genetic timetables</h2>

    <p>
      When we first introduced Papert&#39;s principle &mdash; that is, the
      idea of growing by inserting new levels of management into old
      agencies &mdash; we did not ask when new layers should be built. If
      managers are inserted too soon, when their workers are still
      immature, little will get done. And if those managers come too late,
      that, too, would delay the mental growth. What could ensure that
      managers are not engaged too late or too soon? We all know children
      who seem to have matured too quickly or too slowly, in various
      respects, to match other areas of their growth. In an ideal system,
      each developing agency would be controlled by another agency
      equipped to introduce new agents just when they&#39;re needed
      &mdash; that is, when enough has been learned to justify the start
      of another stage. In any case, it would surely be disastrous if all
      our potential capacity to learn became available too soon. If every
      agent could learn from birth, they&#39;d all be overwhelmed by
      infantile ideas.</p>

    <p>
      One way to regulate such things would be to actuate new agencies at
      genetically predetermined times. At various stages of biological
      <em>maturity,</em> certain classes of agents would be enabled to
      establish new connections, while others would be forced to slow
      their growth by making permanent connections that, till then, had
      been reversible.  Could any clockwork scheme like this be guaranteed
      to work? Consider the fact that most of our children acquire agents
      like Reversible and Confined before they are five years old. For
      those children, at least, it would suffice to activate new
      intermediate-level agents at that age, so those children could
      proceed to build agents like Appearance and History. However,
      children who weren&#39;t ready yet would then be slightly
      handicapped by being forced to build some less-than-usually
      effective Societies-of-More. Nor would that rigid maturation-
      schedule serve well those children who had already moved <em>ahead
	of schedule.</em> It would be better to have systems in which the
      timing of each stage depends on what has actually happened earlier.</p>

    <p>
      One way a stagelike episode might start could stem from what we
      called the investment principle: once a certain skill surpasses all
      its close competitors, it becomes increasingly likely to be employed
      &mdash; and thereby increases its opportunities to develop even
      further. This self-enhancing effect can cause a spurt of rapid
      progress in which a particular skill quickly comes to dominate the
      scene. One way a stagelike episode might end could stem from what we
      called the exception principle. To see how this could happen,
      suppose that a certain agency develops so useful a way to do some
      job that many other agencies soon learn to exploit that
      capability. The more those other agencies become dependent on that
      skill, the more disruption will result from every
      further <em>improvement</em> in it &mdash; since it now has more
      customers to please! Even increasing the speed of one process could
      damage other agencies that depend upon how long it takes to
      work. Thus, once a scheme persists for long enough, it gets to be
      extremely hard to change &mdash; not because of limitations inherent
      in itself or in the agency that developed it, but because of how the
      rest of the society depends upon its present form.</p>

    <p>
      Once it becomes too hard to change an old agency, it is time to
      build another one; further progress may require revolution rather
      than evolution. This is another reason why a complex system must be
      grown in a sequence of separate steps.</p>
