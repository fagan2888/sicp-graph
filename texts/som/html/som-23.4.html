    <h2><em>23.4</em> the meanings of more</h2>

    <p>
      Let&#39;s return just one time more to all the things that More can
      mean.  Each usage has a different sense &mdash; more powerful; more
      meaningful &mdash; and each such meaning must be learned. In other
      words, each use of More involves a connection with an agent for some
      adjective. But More must also engage some systematic use of
      isonomes, since all the different meanings share a certain common
      character.</p>

    <p>
      When we hear the word <em>more,</em> we become disposed to make
      comparisons.</p>

    <p>
      This suggests that More engages both an accumulation of different
      meanings and also some systematic, isonomelike effect. Indeed, More
      could exploit our time-blinking mechanism, which already uses
      isonomes to make comparisons. To do that, More would have to
      activate a memory-control process that <em>blinks</em> whichever
      pronomes have been assigned to the things to be compared. Then their
      differences would be computed automatically.</p>

    <p>
      More needs two additional ingredients. We&#39;d never ask, all by
      itself,
      <em>Which one is more, an apple or a pear?</em> &mdash; because our
      general- purpose comparison script would generate
      difference-descriptions in too many agencies. We also need to know
      which kind of difference is of concern at the moment. So we scarcely
      ever say <em>more</em> by itself but usually attach some modifier
      &mdash; more red, say, or more expensive. Of course, if our focus of
      concern is already clear from the context &mdash; for example, if it
      is clear that we want to know whether apples or pears are more
      expensive &mdash; then we need not express this explicitly.</p>

    <p>
      Finally, it is one thing to find a difference, but another to know
      whether to call it <em>more</em> or <em>less.</em> It may seem
      self-evident that Taller corresponds to <em>more,</em> and Thinner
      corresponds to <em>less</em> &mdash; yet that is something we once
      had to learn. This is the other ingredient of More: we need another
      polyneme to say which sorts of differences should be considered
      positive. In English we sometimes encode such preferences as choices
      between pairs of adjectives like <em>large</em> and</p>

    <p>
      <em>small,</em> but we do not have pairs of words for concepts such
      as
      <em>triangular</em> or <em>red,</em> presumably because we do not
      think of them as having <em>natural</em> opposites. Instead, we can
      use word-pairs like
      <em>more red</em> and <em>less triangular.</em> We can even modify
      the words themselves; we often say <em>redder</em>
      or <em>rounder</em> &mdash; but for some reason we never
      say <em>triangularer.</em></p>

    <p>
      How does one answer a question like <em>Which is bigger, a large
	mouse or a small elephant?</em> We can&#39;t compare two
      descriptions until we engage enough knowledge to construct
      suitable representations of them. One way to compare mouse and
      elephant would be to envision another entity of intermediate
      size. A suitcase would be suitable for this, since it could hold
      the largest mouse but not the smallest elephant. How do you find
      such standards for comparison? That can take considerable time,
      during which you have to search your memories for structures that
      can serve as links for longer chains of comparisons. As life
      proceeds, each person&#39;s concept of More grows more and more
      elaborate. When it comes to notions like more similar, more
      interesting, or <em>more difficult,</em> there seems no limit to
      the complexity of what a word like <em>more</em> can represent.</p>
