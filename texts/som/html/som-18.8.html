    <p>
      Scientists and philosophers are always searching for simplicity.
      They&#39;re happiest when each new thing can be defined in terms of
      things that have already been defined. If we can keep doing this,
      then everything can be defined in successive layers and levels. This
      is how mathematicians usually define numbers. They begin by defining
      Zero &mdash; or, rather, they assume that Zero needs no
      definition. Then they define One as the <em>successor</em> of Zero,
      Two as the successor of One, and so on. But why prefer such slender
      chains? Why not prefer each thing to be connected to as many other
      things as possible? The answer is a sort of paradox.  As scientists,
      we like to make our theories as delicate and fragile as possible. We
      like to arrange things so that if the slightest thing goes wrong,
      everything will collapse at once!</p>

    <p>
      Why do scientists use such shaky strategies? So that when anything
      goes wrong, they&#39;ll be the first to notice it. Scientists adore
      that flimsiness because it helps them find the precious proofs they
      love, with each next step in perfect mesh with every single previous
      one.  Even when the process fails, it only means that we have made a
      new discovery! Especially in the world of mathematics, it is just as
      bad to be nearly right as it is to be totally wrong. In a sense,
      that&#39;s just what mathematics is &mdash; the quest for absolute
      consistency.</p>

    <p>
      But that isn&#39;t good psychology. In real life, our minds must
      always tolerate beliefs that later turn out to be wrong. It&#39;s
      also bad the way we let teachers shape our children&#39;s
      mathematics into slender, shaky tower chains instead of robust,
      cross-connected webs. A chain can break at any link, a tower can
      topple at the slightest shove. And that&#39;s what happens in a
      mathematics class to a child&#39;s mind whose attention turns just
      for a moment to watch a pretty cloud.</p>

    <p>
      Teachers try to convince their students that equations and formulas
      are more expressive than ordinary words. But it takes years to
      become proficient at using the language of mathematics, and until
      then, formulas and equations are in most respects even less
      trustworthy than commonsense reasoning. Accordingly, the investment
      principle works against the mathematics teacher, because even though
      the potential usefulness of formal mathematics is great, it is also
      so remote that most children will continue to use only their
      customary methods in ordinary life, outside of school. It is not
      enough to tell them, <em>Someday you will find this useful,</em> or
      even, <em>Learn this and I will love you.</em> Unless the new ideas
      become connected to the rest of the child&#39;s world, that
      knowledge can&#39;t be put to work.</p>

    <p>
      The ordinary goals of ordinary citizens are not the same as those of
      professional mathematicians and philosophers &mdash; who like to put
      things into forms with as few connections as possible. For children
      know from everyday experience that the more cross-connected their
      common-sense ideas are, the more useful they&#39;re likely to
      be. Why do so many schoolchildren learn to fear mathematics? Perhaps
      in part because we try to teach the children those formal
      definitions, which were designed to lead to meaning-networks as
      sparse and thin as possible. We shouldn&#39;t assume that making
      careful, narrow definitions will always help children <em>get things
	straight.</em> It can also make it easier for them to get things
      scrambled up. Instead, we ought to help them build more robust
      networks in their heads.</p>
