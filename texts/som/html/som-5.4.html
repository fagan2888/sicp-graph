    <h2><em>5.4</em> personal identity</h2>

    <p>
      Why do we accept that paradoxical image of a central Self inside the
      self? Because it serves us well in many spheres of practical life. Here
      are some reasons to regard a person as a single thing.</p>

    <p>
      The Physical World: Our bodies act like other objects that take up
      space. Because of that, we must base our plans and decisions on having a
      single body. Two people cannot fit where there is room for only one
      &mdash; nor can a person walk through walls or stay aloft without
      support.</p>

    <p>
      Personal Privacy: When Mary tells Jack something, she must remember
      to <em>whom</em> it was told, and she must not assume that every other
      person knows it, too. Also, without the concept of an individual, we
      could have no sense of responsibility.
      
      Mental Activity: We often find it hard to think two different thoughts
      at once particularly when they&#39;re similar, because we
      get <em>confused</em> when the same agencies are asked to do different
      jobs at the same time.</p>

    <p>
      Why do our mental processes so often seem to us to flow in <em>streams
        of consciousness</em>? Perhaps because, in order to keep control, we
      have to simplify how we represent what&#39;s happening. Then, when
      that complicated mental scene is <em>straightened out,</em> it seems
      as though a single pipeline of ideas were flowing through the mind.</p>

    <p>
      These are all compelling reasons why it helps to see ourselves as
      singletons. Still, each of us must also learn not only that different
      people have their own identities, but that the same person can entertain
      different beliefs, plans, and dispositions at the same time.</p>

    <p>
      For finding good ideas about psychology, the single-agent image has
      become a grave impediment. To comprehend the human mind is surely one of
      the hardest tasks any mind can face. The legend of the single Self can
      only divert us from the target of that inquiry.</p>
