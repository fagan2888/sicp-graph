    <p>
      The diagram below depicts a connection-scheme that permits many
      agents to communicate with one another, yet uses surprisingly few
      connection wires. It was invented by Calvin E. Mooers in 1946,
      before the modern era of computers. Here is how we could use just
      ten wires to enable any of several
      hundred <em>transmitting-agents</em> to activate any of a similar
      number of <em>receiving-agents.</em> The trick is to make each
      transmitting-agent excite not one, but five of those wires, chosen
      at random from the available ten. Then each receiving-agent is
      provided with an AND-agent connected to recognize the same five-wire
      combination.</p>

    <p>
      In this example, each receiving-agent is aroused by precisely one
      transmitting-agent. If we wanted each receiving-agent to respond to
      several transmitting-agents, we could join together several separate
      recognizers so that the receiving-agent&#39;s input looks like a
      tree with a recognizer at the tip of each branch. How could those
      receivers learn which input patterns to recognize? One way would be
      to use the kind of evidence-weighing machinery we described
      earlier. Indeed, for brain cells that would seem quite plausible,
      since a typical brain cell actually has a treelike network to
      collect its input signals. No one yet knows quite what those
      networks do, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if many of them turn
      out to be simple Perceptron-like learning machines.</p>

    <p>
      The network shown in the diagram above has a serious deficiency: it
      can transmit only one signal at a time. The problem is that if
      several transmitting-agents were aroused at once, almost all ten
      connecting wires would be activated, which would then arouse all the
      receiving-agents and cause an avalanche. However, we can make that
      problem disappear by providing the system with enough additional
      connection wires. For example, suppose there were ten thousand
      connection wires rather than ten, and that each transmitting-agent
      became attached to about fifty of them. Then, even if one hundred
      agents were to send their signals all at once, there would be less
      than one chance in a trillion that this would erroneously activate
      any particular receiving-agent!</p>
