<h2><em>24.3</em> How <i>trans</i>-frames work</h2>

    <p>
      In order to be more concrete, let&#39;s make a little theory of how
      a frame might actually work. Consider, for example, a Trans-frame
      that is filled in to represent this sentence:</p>

    <p>
      Jack drove from Boston to New York on the turnpike with Mary.</p>

    <p>
      Whenever this particular frame is active, if you wonder about the
      Destination of that trip, you&#39;ll almost instantly think of New
      York.  This suggests that the polyneme for New York must be aroused
      by the coincidence of two mental events, namely, the arousal of this
      particular travel-frame and the arousal of the pronome for
      Destination. Now how could a brain-agent recognize such a
      coincidence? Simple: we need only assume that the polyneme for New
      York is attached to an AND-agent with two inputs; one of them
      represents the arousal of the travel-frame itself, and the other
      represents the arousal of the Destination pronome. Accordingly, each
      terminal of our frame could simply be an AND-agent with two inputs.</p>

    <p>
      According to this simple scheme, a frame could consist of little
      more than a collection of AND-agents, one for each of the
      frame&#39;s pronome terminals! Then the entire frame for the New
      York trip would look like this:</p>
    <img class="illus" src="./illus/ch24/24-2.png" class="illus"/>

    <p>
      When a frame-agent is activated &mdash; either by seeing, hearing,
      or imagining something &mdash; this supplies each of those
      AND-agents with one of these two inputs. The second input is
      provided by some pronome which can thereby activate whichever agent
      or frame is presently assigned to that terminal. If several pronomes
      are active at the same time, all the corresponding agents will be
      activated, too.  When the frame above is active, the pronome for
      Origin will activate the K-line for Boston, and the pronome for
      Vehicle will activate the K-line for car.</p>

    <p>
      How could such a frame be made to learn which polynemes should fill
      its terminals? We could begin with each terminal initially connected
      to a virgin K-line; then each terminal will represent whatever the
      corresponding K-line learns. Notice that to build frames this way,
      we need only connect AND-agents to K-lines that can in turn be
      constructed from little more than simple AND-type agents. One of the
      great surprises of modern computer science was the discovery that so
      much can be done with so few kinds of ingredients.</p>
