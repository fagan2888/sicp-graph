<h2><em>21.2</em> pronomes</h2>

    <p>
      Why are sentences so easy to understand? How do we compress our
      ideas into strings of words and, later, get them out again?
      Typically, an English sentence is built around a verb that
      represents some sort of act, event, or change:</p>

    <p>
      Jack drove from Boston to New York on the turnpike with Mary.</p>

    <p>
      As soon as you hear such a thing, parts of your mind become engaged
      with these sorts of concerns related to driving:</p>

    <p>
      These concerns and <em>roles</em> seem so important that every
      language has developed special word-forms or grammatical
      constructions for them. How do we know who drove the car? We know
      that it&#39;s <em>Jack</em> &mdash; because the Actor comes before
      the verb. How do we know a car was involved? Because that is the
      default Vehicle for <em>drive.</em> When did all this happen? In the
      past &mdash; because the verb drive has the form dr-o-ve.  Where did
      the journey start and end? We know that those places are Boston and
      New York, respectively, because in English the prepositions from and
      to precede the Origin and Destination. But we often use the same
      prepositions for different kinds of concerns. In the sentence about
      driving, <em>from</em> and <em>to</em> refer to places in space. But
      in the sentence below they refer to intervals of time:</p>

    <p>
      He changed the liquid from water to wine.</p>

    <p>
      The liquid has changed its composition from what it was <em>at</em>
      some previous time. In English we use prepositions
      like <em>from,</em> <em>to,</em> and
      <em>at</em> both for places in space and for moments in time. This
      is not an accident, since representing both space and time in
      similar ways lets us apply the selfsame reasoning skills to both of
      them. Thus, many of our language-grammar <em>rules</em> embody or
      reflect some systematic correspondences &mdash; and these are among
      our most powerful ways to think. Many other language-forms have
      evolved similarly to make it easy for us to formulate, and
      communicate, our most significant concerns. The next few sections
      discuss how the <em>pronomes</em> we mentioned earlier could be
      involved in processes we use to make both verbal and
      nonverbal <em>chains of reasoning.</em></p>
