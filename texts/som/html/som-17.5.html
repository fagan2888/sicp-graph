    <h2><em>17.5</em> developmental stages</h2>

    <p>
      On the surface, the theories of Jean Piaget and Sigmund Freud might
      seem to lie in different scientific universes. Piaget seems to be
      concerned almost wholly with intellectual matters, while Freud
      studies emotional mechanisms. Yet the differences are not really
      clear. It is widely understood that emotional behavior depends on
      unconscious machinery, but we do not so often recognize that
      ordinary <em>intellectual</em> thinking also depends on mechanisms
      that are equally hidden from introspection.</p>

    <p>
      In any case, despite their differences, both these great
      psychologists asserted that every child proceeds
      through <em>stages</em> of mental development. And surely every
      parent notices how children sometimes seem to stay the same but at
      other times appear to change more rapidly.  Rather than review
      particular theories of how children progress through stages,
      let&#39;s look at the concept of <em>stage</em> itself.</p>

    <p>
      Why can&#39;t we grow by steady, smooth development?</p>

    <p>
      I&#39;ll argue that nothing so complex as a human mind can grow,
      except in separate steps. One reason is that it is always dangerous
      to change a system that already works. Suppose you discover a new
      idea or way to think that seems useful enough to justify building
      more skills that depend on it. What happens if, later, it should
      turn out that this idea has a serious flaw? How could you restore
      your previous abilities?  One way might be to maintain such complete
      records that you could
      <em>undo</em> all the changes that were made &mdash; but that
      wouldn&#39;t work if those changes had already made your quality of
      thought so poor that you couldn&#39;t recognize how poor it had
      become. A safer way would be to keep some older versions of your
      previous mind intact as you constructed each new version. Then you
      could <em>regress</em> to a previous stage in case the new one
      failed, and you could also use it to evaluate the performance of the
      new stage.</p>

    <p>
      Another conservative strategy is never to let a new stage take
      control of actual behavior until there is evidence that it can
      outperform its predecessor. What would an outside observer see if a
      child employed this strategy? One would observe
      only <em>plateaus,</em> during which there were few apparent changes
      in behavior, followed by <em>spurts of growth</em> in which new
      capacities emerge suddenly. Yet that appearance would be illusory,
      since the actual times of development would occur within those
      silent periods. This scheme has the great advantage of permitting
      the child to continue to function during mental growth and, thus,
      maintain <em>business during renovations.</em>  Each working version
      can hold still while new ones safely move ahead.</p>

    <p>
      This applies to every large organization, not only to those involved
      in a child&#39;s development. Given a community that is already
      functioning, it is always dangerous to make more than a few changes
      at once. Each change is prone to have some harmful side effects on
      other systems that depend on it. Some of those side effects may not
      become apparent until so many of them have accumulated that the
      system has deteriorated past any point of turning back. Accordingly,
      it is better to stop from time to time to make inspections and
      repairs.  The same is true for learning any complex skill; unless
      your goal is held unchanged for long enough, you won&#39;t have time
      enough to learn the skills required to accomplish it. It simply
      isn&#39;t practical to make minds grow by steady, smooth
      development.</p>
