    <h2><em>16.10</em> adult emotions</h2>

 <blockquote>
   Since emotions are few and reasons are many (said the robot,
   Giskard), the behavior of a crowd can be more easily predicted than
   the behavior of one person can.
      <cite>&mdash;Isaac Asimov</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      What are emotions, anyway? Our culture sees this question as a deep
      and ancient mystery. How could the idea of society of mind
      contribute to what our ancestors have said? Common-sense psychology
      has not even reached a consensus on which emotions exist.</p>

      Anxiety Lust!--> If there exists anger, what constitutes rage? How does
      fear relate to fright, terror, dread, dismay, and all such other
      awful things? How does love relate to reverence or to attachment or
      infatuation? Are these just various degrees of intensity and
      direction, or are they genuinely different entities that happen to
      be neighbors in an uncharted universe of affections? Are hate and
      love quite separate things, or, similarly, courage and cowardice
      &mdash; or are these merely pairs of extremes, each just the absence
      of its peer? What are emotions, anyway, and what are all the other
      things we label moods, feelings, passions, needs, or sensibilities?
      We find it hard to agree on the meanings of words like these,
      presumably because few of them actually correspond to clearly
      distinct mental processes. Instead, when we learn such words, we
      each attach to them variously different and personal accumulations
      of conceptions in our minds.</p>

    <p>
      Infants&#39; early emotion signs clearly signify their needs. We
      later learn to use such signals in more exploitative ways. Thus you
      can learn to use affection or anger as a social coin in trade for
      various accommodations; for example, one can pretend to be angry or
      pleased, or even offer &mdash; that is, threaten or promise &mdash;
      to become angry or affectionate in certain circumstances. Our
      culture is ambivalent about such matters; on one side we&#39;re
      taught that emotions should be natural and spontaneous; on the other
      side we&#39;re told that we must learn to regulate them. We
      recognize in deeds (though not in words) that feeling may be easier
      to understand and modify than other parts of intellect. We censure
      those who fail to learn to control their emotions but merely pity
      those whose problem-solving capabilities are poor; we blame
      for <em>lack of self-control,</em> but not for <em>weakness of
	intelligence.</em></p>

    <p>
      Our earliest emotions are built-in processes in which inborn
      proto-specialists control what happens in our brains. Soon we learn
      to overrule those schemes, as our surroundings teach us what we
      ought to feel. Parents, teachers, friends, and finally our
      self-ideals impose upon us new rules for how to use the remnants of
      those early states: they teach us how and when to feel and show each
      kind of emotion sign. By the time we&#39;re adults, these systems
      have become too complicated to understand. By the time we&#39;ve
      passed through all those stages of development, our grown-up minds
      have been rebuilt too many times to remember or understand much of
      how it felt to be an infant.</p>
