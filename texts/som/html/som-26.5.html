<h2><em>26.5</em> story-frames</h2>

    <p>
      We take it for granted that anyone can understand a story. But every
      kind of narrative demands some <em>listening skills.</em> Even the
      best storytellers find it hard to entertain children, who are prone
      to interrupt with questions that make perfect sense by themselves
      but drift away from the story&#39;s theme. <em>Where does Mary
	live?</em> <em>Does she have a dog?</em> To listen well, a child
      must acquire potent forms of self-control.</p>

    <p>
      The storyteller, too, must work to fix the focus of the
      listener&#39;s mind.  If you were speaking about something else and
      suddenly, completely out of context, remarked, <em>Mary was invited
	to Jack&#39;s party,</em> an unprepared listener might
      wonder, <em>Mary who?</em> and look to see if you were addressing
      someone else. But you can first prepare the listener by
      saying, <em>Would you like to hear a story?</em> or simply, <em>Once
	upon a time . . .</em> What is the function of such a phrase? It has
      a very specific effect: to set the listener into a normal and
      familiar state of expecting to hear a certain type of narrative
      &mdash; a story. In the English tradition, stories typically begin
      by specifying the time &mdash; if only vaguely, by saying <em>long
	ago.</em> I&#39;m told that in Japan most stories start with saying
      where as well &mdash; if only by some empty phrase like <em>in a
	certain time and place.</em> The biblical book of Job begins
      with, <em>There was a man in the land of Uz . . .</em></p>

    <p>
      Most stories start with just enough to set the scene. Then they
      introduce some characters, with hints about their principal
      concerns.  Next, the storyteller gives some clues about
      some <em>main event</em> or problem to be solved. From that point
      on, the listener has a general idea of what comes next: there will
      be more development of the problem; then it will be resolved,
      somehow; and then the story will end, perhaps by giving some
      practical or moral advice. In any case, those magic story-starting
      words arouse, in knowing listeners&#39; minds, great hosts of
      expectation-frames to help the listeners anticipate which terminals
      to fill.</p>

    <p>
      Beyond arousing all these specific expectations, <em>once upon a
	time</em> plays one more crucial role: it says that what comes after
      it is fictional or, in any case, far too remote to activate much
      personal concern.  Instead, it tells the listener to disregard the
      normal sympathies one should feel when real persons meet the
      monstrous destinies so usual in children&#39;s tales: to be turned
      into toads, imprisoned in stones, or devoured by terrible dragon
      beasts.</p>
