      <h2><em>10.5</em> the society-of-more</h2>

    <p>
      Think how many meanings <em>more</em> must have! We seem to use a
      different one for every sort of thing we know.</p>

    <p>
      More red.  More loud.  More swift.  More old.  More tall.  More
      soft. More cruel.  More alive.  More glad.  More wealthy.</p>

    <p>
      Each usage has a distinct sense, involving different agencies. How
      could all these ways to make comparisons get grouped into just one
      society? Here&#39;s a Society-of-More a child might use to deal with
      that egg cup problem.</p>

    <p>
      This society has two main divisions. In its Appearance division, a
      Spatial subdivision considers both the increased extent occupied by
      the spread-out eggs and also their thinned-out appearance or reduced
      density. In the case of those spread-out eggs, these conflict
      &mdash; and the Spatial agency withdraws. Then, if the child can
      count, Numerical decides; otherwise the History division applies
      some agents that use memories of recent happenings. If some of the
      eggs were rolled away, Confined would say that their amount is no
      longer the same; if the eggs were merely moved around, Reversible
      would claim that their amount cannot have changed.</p>

    <p>
      To solve the water jar problem, the Society-of-More would need other
      kinds of lower-level agents:</p>

    <p>
      You might complain that even if we needed these hordes of
      lower-level agencies to make comparisons, this system has too many
      middle-level managers. But those mountains of bureaucracy are more
      than worth their cost. Each higher-level agent embodies a form of
      <em>higher-order</em> knowledge that helps us organize ourselves by
      telling us when and how to use the things we know. Without a many
      layered management, we couldn&#39;t use the knowledge in our
      low-level agencies; they&#39;d all keep getting in one another&#39;s
      way.</p>
