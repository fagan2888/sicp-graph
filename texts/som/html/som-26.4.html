      Dictionary definitions never say enough. Every child knows that a
      party is more than just a gathering assembled to celebrate
      someone&#39;s birthday. But no brief definition can describe the
      complicated customs, rules, and regulations that typical communities
      prescribe for such ceremonies. When I was a child, a birthday party
      could be expected to include at least the elements of the following
      script:</p>

    <p>
      ARRIVAL.  Greeting. Be well dressed.  GIFT.  Give birthday present
      to host or guest of honor.</p>

    <p>
      GAMES.  Activities like blindfold competitions.  DECOR.
      Balloons. Favors. Crepe-paper decorations.  PARTY-MEAL.  Hotdogs,
      candies, ice-cream, etc.  CAKE.  With candles to represent the
      host&#39;s age.  CEREMONY.  Host tries to extinguish candles with
      single breath (to make a wish).  SONG.  All guests sing birthday
      song and eat cake.</p>

    <p>
      This is merely an outline, for every item leads to other conditions
      and requirements. The birthday present has to please the host, of
      course, but there are other strong constraints on it as well. It
      ought to be brand new, of good quality, and it should not be
      ostentatiously extravagant. It ought to be
      suitably <em>party-wrapped</em> &mdash; that is, covered with a
      certain kind of color-printed wrapping paper and tied with colored
      ribbon. There are also constraints on other items in the script. The
      birthday cake should be covered with a sweet sugar frosting. In my
      childhood, the ice cream usually consisted of three colored stripes
      of different flavors: vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate. Because I
      did not like the strawberry flavor, my personal party script
      included the extra steps of finding another child willing to make a
      trade.</p>

    <p>
      To all their young participants, such parties unfold exactly as a
      party should, with all these queer complexities. We take our social
      customs for granted, as though they were natural phenomena. Few
      guests or hosts will ever wonder why their parties have those
      explicit forms or ask about their origins. As far as any child can
      tell, that&#39;s just how parties ought to go; they always did and
      always will. And so it is with almost everything we know.</p>
