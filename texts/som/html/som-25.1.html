      Each of the drawings below can be seen in at least two different
      ways.</p>

    <p>
      The drawing on the left might represent either a single candlestick
      or two people facing each other. The drawing on the right looks like
      a cube &mdash; but first it looks like a cube as seen from above and
      then, suddenly, it looks like a cube as seen from below. Why does
      each drawing seem to change its character from time to time? Why
      can&#39;t we see both forms at once? Because, it seems, our agencies
      can tolerate just one interpretation at a time.</p>

    <p>
      We must ask certain questions here. First, what enables us to see
      those pictures as composed of the features we call by names like
      edges, lines, corners, and areas? Our vision-systems seem virtually
      compelled to group the outputs of our sensors into entities like
      these. Next, what enables us to see those features as grouped
      together to form larger objects?  Apparently, our vision-systems
      again are virtually compelled to represent each of those features,
      be it a corner, edge, or area, as belonging to one and only one
      larger object at a time. I won&#39;t discuss those questions in this
      book except to suggest a general hypothesis:</p>

    <p>
      Our vision-systems are born equipped, on each of several different
      levels, with some sort of <em>locking-in</em> machinery that at
      every moment permits each <em>part,</em> at each level, to be
      assigned to one and only one <em>whole</em> at the next level.</p>

    <p>
      We should also ask, how do we recognize those objects as examples of
      familiar things like faces, cubes, or candlesticks? And again
      we&#39;ll make the similar hypothesis that our memory-frame
      machinery also uses <em>locking-in</em> machinery that permits
      each <em>object</em> to be attached only to one frame at a time. The
      end result is that in every region of the picture, the frames must
      compete with one another to account for each feature.</p>
