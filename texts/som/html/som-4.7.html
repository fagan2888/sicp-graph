    <h2><em>4.7</em> long-range plans</h2>

    <p>
      We often become involved in projects that we can&#39;t complete. It is
      easy to solve small problems because we can treat them as though they
      were detached from all our other goals. But it is different for projects
      that span larger portions of our lives, like learning a trade, raising a
      child, or writing a book. We cannot simply <em>decide</em> or
      <em>choose</em> to accomplish an enterprise that makes a large demand
      for time, because it will inevitably conflict with other interests and
      ambitions. Then we&#39;ll be forced to ask questions like these:</p>

    <p>
      What must I give up for this?  What will I learn from it?  Will it bring
      power and influence?  Will I remain interested in it?  Will other people
      help me with it?  Will they still like me?</p>

    <p>
      Perhaps the most difficult question of all is, <em>How will adopting
        this goal change me?</em> Just wanting to own a large, expensive
      house, for instance, can lead to elaborate thoughts like these:</p>

    <p>
      <em>That means I&#39;d have to save for years and not get other things
        I&#39;d like. I doubt that I could bear it. True, I could reform
        myself, and try to be more thrifty and deliberate. But that&#39;s just
        not the sort of person I am.</em></p>

    <p>
      Until such doubts are set aside, all the plans we make will be subject
      to the danger that we may <em>change our mind.</em> So how can any
      long-range plan succeed? The easiest path to <em>self-control</em> is
      doing only what one is already disposed to do.</p>

    <p>
      Many of the schemes we use for self-control are the same as those we
      learn to use for influencing other people. We make ourselves behave by
      exploiting our own fears and desires, offering ourselves rewards, or
      threatening the loss of what we love. But when short-range tricks
      won&#39;t keep us to our projects for long enough, we may need some way
      to make changes that won&#39;t let us change ourselves back again.  I
      suspect that, in order to commit ourselves to our largest, most
      ambitious plans, we learn to exploit agencies that operate on larger
      spans of time.</p>

    <p>
      Which are our slowest-changing agencies of all? Later we&#39;ll see that
      these must include the silent, hidden agencies that shape what we call
      character. These are the systems that are concerned not merely with the
      things we want, but with what we want ourselves to be &mdash; that is,
      the ideals we set for ourselves.</p>
