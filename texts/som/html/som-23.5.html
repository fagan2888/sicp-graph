<h2><em>23.5</em> foreign accents</h2>

    <p>
      It is not unusual for an adult to learn a second language with
      nearly perfect mastery of grammar and vocabulary. But once past
      adolescence, most people never manage to imitate the new
      language&#39;s pronunciation perfectly, no matter how long and hard
      they work at it. In other words, they speak with <em>foreign
	accents.</em> Even when another speaker tries to help with <em>Say
	it like this, not that,</em> the learner is unable to learn what
      changes to make. Most people who change countries in their later
      teens never learn to speak the way the natives do.</p>

    <p>
      Why do adults find it so hard to learn how to pronounce new word
      sounds? Some like to say that this reflects a general decline in the
      learning capacities of older people, but that appears to be a myth.
      Instead, I suspect this particular disability is caused, more or
      less directly, by a genetically programmed mechanism that disables
      our ability to learn to make new connections in or between the
      agents we use to represent speech sounds. There is evidence that our
      brains use different machinery for recognizing language sounds than
      for recognizing other sorts of sounds, particularly for the little
      speech- sound units that language scientists call <em>phonemes.</em>
      Most human languages use less than a hundred phonemes.</p>

    <p>
      Why should we be able to learn many different speech sounds before
      the age of puberty but find it so much harder to learn new ones
      afterward? I suspect that this link to puberty is no coincidence.
      Instead, one or more of the genetically controlled mechanisms that
      brings on sexual maturity also acts to reduce the capacities of
      these particular agencies to learn to recognize and make new sounds!
      But why did this peculiar disability evolve? What evolutionary
      survival advantage would favor individuals whose genes reduce, after
      that age, this particular ability to learn? Consider this
      hypothesis:</p>

    <p>
      The onset of the childbearing age is the biological moment when a
      person&#39;s social role changes from learner to teacher.
      The <em>evolutionary purpose</em> of suppressing speech-sound
      learning may simply serve to prevent the parent from learning</p>

    <p>
      the child&#39;s speech &mdash; thus making the child learn the
      adult&#39;s speech instead!</p>

    <p>
      Wouldn&#39;t parents want to teach the children their language
      anyway? Not necessarily. In the short run, a parent is usually more
      concerned with communication than with instruction. Accordingly, if
      we found it easier to imitate our children&#39;s sounds, that&#39;s
      what we&#39;d do. But if parents were inclined and able to learn to
      speak the ways their children do, those children would lose both
      incentive and opportunity to learn to speak like adults, and &mdash;
      if every child acquired a different set of language sounds &mdash;
      no common, public language would ever have evolved in the first
      place! If this is right, puberty-linked genes for suppressing
      speech-sound learning may have formed fairly early in the evolution
      of human languages. No one knows when that occurred, but if
      biologists could find and date the genes for this, we could obtain a
      clue about the time of language&#39;s unknown origin, perhaps within
      the last half million years.  sh\</p>
