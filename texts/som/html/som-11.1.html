    <h2><em>11.1</em> seeing red</h2>

    <p>
      What possible kind of brain-event could correspond to anything like
      the meaning of an ordinary word? When you say <em>red,</em> your
      vocal cords obey commands from <em>pronouncing agents</em> in your
      brain, which make your chest and larynx muscles move to produce that
      special sound. These agents must in turn receive commands from
      somewhere else, where other agents respond to signals from yet other
      places. All those <em>places</em> must comprise the parts of some
      society of mental agencies.</p>

    <p>
      It&#39;s easy to design a machine to tell when there is something
      red: start with sensors that respond to different hues of light, and
      connect the ones most sensitive to red to a
      central <em>red-agent,</em> making corrections for the color of the
      lighting of the scene. We could make this machine appear
      to <em>speak</em> by linking each color-agent to a device that
      pronounces the corresponding word. Then this machine could name the
      colors it <em>sees</em> &mdash; and even distinguish more hues than
      ordinary people can. But it would be a travesty to call
      this <em>sight,</em> since it&#39;s nothing but a catalog that lists
      a lot of colored dots. It would share no human notion of what colors
      come to mean to us, because without some sense of texture, form, and
      very much more, it would have few of the qualities of our human
      kinds of images and thoughts.</p>

    <p>
      Of course no little diagram can capture more than a fragment of any
      real person&#39;s thoughts about the world. But this should not be
      taken to mean that no machine could ever have the range of
      sensibilities that people have. It merely means that we aren&#39;t
      simple machines; indeed, we should understand that in learning to
      comprehend the qualities of vast machines, we are still in the dark
      ages. And in any case, a diagram can only illustrate a principle:
      there cannot be any compact way to represent all the details of
      full-grown mind-society.  To talk about such complex things, we can
      only resort to language tricks that make our listeners&#39; minds
      explore the worlds inside themselves.</p>
