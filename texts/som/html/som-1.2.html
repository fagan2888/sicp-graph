    <h2><em>1.2</em> The mind and the brain</h2>

    <blockquote>
      It was never supposed <em>[the poet Imlac said]</em> that
      cogitation is inherent in matter, or that every particle is a
      thinking being. Yet if any part of matter be devoid of thought,
      what part can we suppose to think? Matter can differ from matter
      only in form, density, bulk, motion, and direction of motion. To
      which of these, however varied or combined, can consciousness be
      annexed? To be round or square, to be solid or fluid, to be
      great or little, to be moved slowly or swiftly, one way or
      another, are modes of material existence all equally alien from
      the nature of cogitation. If matter be once without thought, it
      can only be made to think by some new modification; but all the
      modifications which it can admit are equally unconnected with
      cogitative powers.
      <cite>&mdash;Samuel Johnson</cite></blockquote>

    <p>
      How could solid-seeming brains support such ghostly things as thoughts?
      This question troubled many thinkers of the past. The world of thoughts
      and the world of things appeared to be too far apart to interact in any
      way. So long as thoughts seemed so utterly different from everything
      else, there seemed to be no place to start.</p>

    <p>
      A few centuries ago it seemed equally impossible to explain Life,
      because living things appeared to be so different from anything else.
      Plants seemed to grow from nothing. Animals could move and learn. Both
      could reproduce themselves &mdash; while nothing else could do such
      things. But then that awesome gap began to close. Every living thing was
      found to be composed of smaller cells, and cells turned out to be
      composed of complex but comprehensible chemicals. Soon it was found that
      plants did not create any substance at all but simply extracted most of
      their material from gases in the air. Mysteriously pulsing hearts turned
      out to be no more than mechanical pumps, composed of networks of muscle
      cells.  But it was not until the present century that John von Neumann
      showed theoretically how cell-machines could reproduce while, almost
      independently, James Watson and Francis Crick discovered how each cell
      actually makes copies of its own hereditary code. No longer does an
      educated person have to seek any special, vital force to animate each
      living thing.</p>

    <p>
      Similarly, a century ago, we had essentially no way to start to explain
      how thinking works. Then psychologists like Sigmund Freud and Jean
      Piaget produced their theories about child development. Somewhat later,
      on the mechanical side, mathematicians like Kurt G&ouml;del and Alan
      Turing began to reveal the hitherto unknown range of what machines could
      be made to do. These two streams of thought began to merge only in the
      1940s, when Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts began to show how machines
      might be made to see, reason, and remember. Research in the modern
      science of Artificial Intelligence started only in the 1950s, stimulated
      by the invention of modern computers. This inspired a flood of new ideas
      about how machines could do what only minds had done previously.</p>

    <p>
      Most people still believe that no machine could ever be conscious, or
      feel ambition, jealousy, humor, or have any other mental
      life-experience. To be sure, we are still far from being able to create
      machines that do all the things people do. But this only means that we
      need better theories about how thinking works. This book will show how
      the tiny machines that we&#39;ll call <em>agents of the mind</em> could
      be the long sought <em>particles</em> that those theories need.</p>
