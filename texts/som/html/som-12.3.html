    <h2><em>12.3</em> uniframes</h2>

    <p>
      The child in our Block-Arch scene examined several different
      arrangements of blocks &mdash; yet ended up describing them as all
      the same!  The great accomplishment was in discovering how to
      describe all the different instances of arch with the selfsame
      phrase, <em>a top supported by two standing blocks that do not
	touch.</em> I&#39;ll use the new word <em>uniframe</em> for this
      &mdash; a description constructed to apply to several different
      things at once. How does a person make a uniframe?</p>

    <p>
      Our child&#39;s Block-Arch uniframe was constructed in several steps
      &mdash; and each step used a different learning-scheme! The first
      step dissects the scene into blocks with specific properties and
      relationships; some were <em>lying down</em> or <em>standing
	up,</em> and some were touching or supporting other ones. Next, we
      required our uniframe to insist that the arch top must be supported
      by the standing blocks: let&#39;s call this enforcement. Then, we
      required our uniframe to reject structures in which the two standing
      blocks touch one another;</p>

    <p>
      we could call this prevention: a way to keep from accepting an
      undesired situation. Finally, we required our uniframe to be neutral
      about the arch top&#39;s shape in order to keep from making
      distinctions we don&#39;t consider relevant. Let&#39;s call that
      tolerance.</p>

    <p>
      How does a person know how to choose which features and relations to
      enforce, prevent, or tolerate? When we compared the two structures
      below, we enforced the relation that A is supported by B and C. But
      think of all the other differences we could have emphasized instead.</p>

    <p>
      Was it wasteful to use only one of these facts when we could have
      used them all? Should we learn to exploit all the information we can
      get? No! There are good reasons not to notice too much, for every
      seemingly essential fact can generate a universe of useless,
      accidental, and even misleading facts.</p>

    <p>
      Most differences are redundant. Most of the rest are accidents.</p>

    <p>
      For example, suppose that we already know A is supported by B.
      There is then no need to remember that A touches B or that A is
      above B &mdash; because these are things that we can figure out. For
      a different kind of example, suppose we knew that A was not
      supported by B. It then seems unnecessary to remember that <em>A was
	to the right of B.</em>  Common sense can tell us that if A is not
      on B, it must lie somewhere else. However, at least in the present
      context, it does not matter whether that <em>somewhere else</em> is
      to the right; another time it might just as likely lie to the
      left. If we stored such details too recklessly, our minds would get
      cluttered up with useless facts.</p>

    <p>
      But how can we judge which facts are useful? On what basis can we
      decide which features are essential and which are merely accidents?
      Such questions can&#39;t be answered as they stand. They make no
      sense apart from how we want to use their answers. There is no
      single secret, magic trick to learning; we simply have to learn a
      large society of different ways to learn!</p>
