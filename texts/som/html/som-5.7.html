    <h2><em>5.7</em> permanent identity</h2>

    <p>
      What do we signify by words like <em>me,</em> <em>myself,</em>
      and <em>I</em>? What does a story mean that starts with <em>In my
        childhood</em>? What is that strange possession <em>you,</em> which
      stays the same throughout your life? Are you the same person you were
      before you learned to read? You scarcely can imagine, now, how words
      looked then. Just try to look at these words without reading them:</p>

    <p>
      We find it almost impossible to separate the appearances of things from
      what they&#39;ve come to mean to us. But if we cannot recollect how
      things appeared to us before we learned to link new meanings to those
      things, what makes us think we can recollect how we ourselves appeared
      to us in previous times? What would you say if someone asked questions
      like these:</p>

    <p>
      <em>Are you the same person now that you once were, before you learned
        to talk?</em>
      <em>Of course I am. Why, who else could I be?</em>
      <em>Do you mean that you haven&#39;t changed at all?</em>
      <em>Of course not. I only mean I&#39;m the same person &mdash; the same
        in some ways, different in others &mdash; but still the same me.</em>
      <em>But how can you be the same as the person you were before you had
        even learned to remember things? Can you even imagine what that was
        like?</em>
      <em>Perhaps I can&#39;t &mdash; yet still there must have been some
        continuity. Even if I can&#39;t remember it, I surely was that person,
        too.</em></p>

    <p>
      We all experience that sense of changelessness in spite of change, not
      only for the past but also for the future, too! Consider how you are
      generous to future self at present self&#39;s expense. Today, you put
      some money in the bank in order that sometime later you can take it out.
      Whenever did that future self do anything so good for you?
      Is <em>you</em> the body of those memories whose meanings change only
      slowly? Is it the never-ending side effects of all your previous
      experience? Or is it just whichever of your agents change the least as
      time and life proceed?</p>
