<h2><em>16.6</em> motivation</h2>

    <p>
      Imagine that a thirsty child has learned to reach for a nearby
      cup. What keeps that child, afterward, from reaching for a cup in
      every other circumstance &mdash; say, when it is lonely or when it
      is cold? How do we keep separate what we learn for satisfying
      different goals? One way is to maintain a separate memory bank for
      every distinct goal.</p>

    <p>
      To make this work, we must restrict each specialist to learn only
      when its own goal is active. We can accomplish that by building them
      into a cross-exclusion system so that, for example, Hunger&#39;s
      memories can be formed only when Hunger is active. Such a system
      will never get confused about which memories to use. When it is
      hungry it will do only what it learned to do at previous times when
      it was hungry; it won&#39;t eat when it is thirsty or drink when it
      is hungry. But it would be too extravagant to have to keep
      completely different memories for every goal &mdash; since, as we
      said, most real-world goals engage the same kinds of knowledge about
      the world. Wouldn&#39;t it be better if all those specialists could
      share a common, general-purpose memory?</p>

    <p>
      This would lead to problems, too. Whenever any specialist tried to
      rearrange some memories to its own advantage, it might damage
      structures upon which the others have come to depend. There would be
      too many unpredictable interactions. How could specialists cooperate
      and share what they have learned? If they were like people, they
      could communicate, negotiate, and organize. But because each
      separate specialist is much too small and specialized to understand
      how the others work, the best each can do is learn to exploit what
      the others can do, without understanding how they do it.</p>
