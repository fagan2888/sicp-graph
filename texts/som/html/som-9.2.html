    <h2><em>9.2</em> gerrymandering</h2>

    <p>
      We all know how accomplishment can bring satisfaction, and we tend
      to assume a direct connection between them. In very simple animals,
      where <em>satisfaction</em> means no more than meeting simple, basic
      needs, satisfaction and accomplishment must indeed be virtually the
      same. But in a complex human brain, a great many layers of agencies
      are interposed between the ones that deal with body needs and those
      that represent or recognize our intellectual accomplishments. Then
      what is the significance, in these more complicated systems, of
      those pleasant feelings of accomplishment and disagreeable
      sensations of defeat? They must be involved with how our
      higher-level agencies make summaries.</p>

    <p>
      Suppose that you once had to send a present to a friend. You had to
      choose a gift and find a box in which to wrap it. Soon, each such
      job turned into several smaller ones &mdash; like finding strings
      and tying them.  The only way to solve hard problems is by breaking
      them into smaller ones and then, when those are too difficult,
      dividing them in turn.  So hard problems always lead to branching
      trees of subgoals and subproblems. To decide where resources should
      be applied, our problem-solving agents need simple summaries of how
      things are going. Let&#39;s suppose each agent&#39;s summary is
      based on other summaries it gets from the agents it supervises. Here
      is a pathological example of what could happen if every such summary
      were based on a simple majority decision:</p>

    <p>
      When all is done, if someone asked if you enjoyed the whole
      experience, you might say that it was <em>fun</em>
      or <em>terrible.</em> But no such summary can say very much of what
      your agencies actually learned.  Your knot-tying processes learned
      which actions worked and failed, your paper-folding and
      gift-selecting processes had other failures and accomplishments; but
      your overall assessment of the experience cannot reflect all those
      details. If the entire episode left you <em>unhappy,</em> you might
      be less inclined to give presents in the future, but that should not
      have much effect on what you learned about folding paper and tying
      string. No single sense of <em>good</em> or <em>bad</em> can reflect
      much of what went on inside all your agencies; too much information
      must be concealed. Then why does it seem so satisfactory for us to
      classify our feelings into positive and negative and conclude
      that <em>on the whole</em> the net effect was bad or good? True,
      sometimes feelings are more mixed and everything seems bittersweet,
      but, as we&#39;ll see, there are many reasons why we have to
      oversimplify.</p>
