    <h2><em>26.3</em> sentence-frames</h2>

    <p>
      We&#39;ve barely started to see what minds must do to comprehend the
      simplest children&#39;s tales. Let&#39;s look again at the beginning
      of our party story.</p>

    <p>
      Mary was invited to Jack&#39;s party.</p>

    <p>
      How marvelous that sentence is! How much it says in just six words!
      Two characters are introduced and quickly cast in clear-cut
      roles. We learn that there will be a party soon, with Jack as the
      host and Mary a guest &mdash; provided she accepts the
      invitation. We also learn that this setting is established in the
      past.</p>

    <p>
      Those six short words tell even more. We can expect the story to
      focus on Mary&#39;s activities rather than Jack&#39;s &mdash;
      because <em>Mary</em> is the first word that attracts our
      attention. But to accomplish that, the narrator had to use a clever
      grammar-tactic. Normally, an English-language sentence begins with a
      phrase that describes the Actor responsible for some action, and we
      usually represent this with a simple Trans-frame.</p>

    <p>
      JACK INVIT &mdash; ed MARY Donor action verb Recipient In
      this <em>active verb</em> form of sentence-frame, the verb is
      sandwiched between two nouns; the first describes a Donor and the
      second describes a Recipient. However, if our storyteller actually
      used the active form of sentence-frame, it would tend to mislead the
      listener into expecting Jack to be the central character of the
      story &mdash; if only because he is mentioned first. Fortunately,
      English grammar provides an alternative sentence-frame in which the
      Recipient is mentioned first &mdash; and which never mentions the
      Donor at all!</p>

    <p>
      MARY was INVIT &mdash; ed Recipient was verb &mdash; ed.</p>

    <p>
      How does the understanding listener detect this <em>passive
	verb</em> sentence-frame? Some language-agent has to notice the way
      the verb is sandwiched between <em>was</em> and <em>-ed.</em> As
      soon as this special subframe is recognized, the language-agency
      will reassign the first noun, Mary, not to the Donor terminal, but
      to the Recipient terminal &mdash; and thus Mary is represented as
      receiving the invitation.  Why don&#39;t we need to say who the
      donor is? Because in this case the listener can assume it by
      default. Specifically, the expression <em>Jack&#39;s party</em>
      evokes a <em>party-invitation frame,</em> and in such situations it
      is typical for the host &mdash; or the host&#39;s parents &mdash; to
      invite the party guests. By thus arousing familiar frames, we can
      say a great deal in a very few words.</p>
