    <h2><em>4.6</em> self-control</h2>

    <blockquote>
      Those who really seek the path to Enlightenment dicate terms to their
      mind. Then they proceed with strong determination.

      <cite>&mdash;Buddha</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The episode of Professor Challenger showed just one way we can control
      ourselves: by exploiting an emotional aversion in order to accomplish an
      intellectual purpose. Consider all the other kinds of tricks we use to
      try to force ourselves to work when we&#39;re tired or distracted.</p>

    <p>
      WILLPOWER: Tell yourself, <em>Don&#39;t give in to that,</em>
      or, <em>Keep on trying.</em></p>

    <p>
      Such self-injunctions can work at first &mdash; but finally they always
      fail, as though some engine in the mind runs out of fuel. Another style
      of self-control involves more physical activity:</p>

    <p>
      ACTIVITY: Move around. Exercise. Inhale. Shout.</p>

    <p>
      Certain physical acts are peculiarly effective, especially the facial
      expressions involved in social communication: they affect the sender as
      much as the recipient.</p>

    <p>
      EXPRESSION: Set jaw. Stiffen upper lip. Furrow brow.</p>

    <p>
      Another kind of stimulating act is moving to a stimulating place. And we
      often perform actions that directly change the brain&#39;s chemical
      environment.</p>

    <p>
      CHEMISTRY: Take coffee, amphetamines, or other brain-affecting drugs.</p>

    <p>
      Then there are actions in the mind with which we set up thoughts and
      fantasies that move our own emotions, arousing hopes and fears through
      self-directed offers, bribes, and even threats.</p>

    <p>
      EMOTION: <em>If I win, there&#39;s much to gain, but more to lose if I
        fail!</em></p>

    <p>
      Perhaps most powerful of all are those actions that promise gain or loss
      of the regard of certain special persons.</p>

    <p>
      ATTACHMENT: Imagine admiration if you succeed &mdash; or disapproval if
      you fail &mdash; especially from those to whom you are attached.</p>

    <p>
      So many schemes for self-control! How do we choose which ones to use?
      There isn&#39;t any easy way. Self-discipline takes years to learn; it
      grows inside us stage by stage.</p>
