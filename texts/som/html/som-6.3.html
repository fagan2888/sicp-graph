    <h2><em>6.3</em> thought-experiments</h2>

    <p>
      How do you discover things about the world? Just look and see! It seems
      simple &mdash; but it&#39;s not. Each casual glance employs a billion
      brain cells to represent the present scene and to summarize its
      differences from records of other experiences. Your agencies formulate
      little bits of theories about what happens in the world and then make
      you do small experiments to confirm or reformulate those conjectures. It
      only seems simple because you&#39;re unaware of what is happening.</p>

    <p>
      How do you discover things about your mind? You use a similar
      technique. You make up little bits of theories about how you think, then
      test them with tiny experiments. The trouble is that thought-experiments
      don&#39;t often lead to the sorts of clear, crisp findings that
      scientists seek. Ask yourself what happens when you try to imagine a
      round square &mdash; or when you try to be happy and sad at the same
      time. Why is it so hard to describe the results of such experiments or
      draw useful conclusions from them? It is because we get confused. Our
      thoughts about our mind-experiments are mind-experiments themselves
      &mdash; and therefore interfere with one another.</p>

    <p>
      Thinking affects our thoughts.</p>

    <p>
      People who program computers encounter similar problems when new
      programs malfunction because of unexpected interactions among their
      parts. To find out what&#39;s happening, programmers have developed
      special programs for <em>debugging</em> other programs. But just as in
      thought-experiments, there is a danger that the program being watched
      might change the one that&#39;s watching it. To prevent this, all modern
      computers are equipped with special <em>interruption</em> machinery that
      detects any other program&#39;s attempt to alter a debugging program;
      when this happens, the culprit is <em>frozen</em> in its tracks so that
      the debugging program can examine it. To do this, the interruption
      machinery must be supplied with a private memory bank that can store
      enough information to make it possible, later, to restart the frozen
      program as though nothing had happened.</p>

    <p>
      Are brains equipped to do similar things? It was easy to build
      self-examination systems into computers that did only one thing at a
      time, but it would be much harder to do in a system that, like the
      brain, engages many processes at once. The problem is that if you were
      to freeze only one process without stopping the others, it would change
      the situation you&#39;re trying to examine. However, if you were to stop
      all those processes all at once, you couldn&#39;t experiment on how they
      interact.</p>

    <p>
      Later, we&#39;ll see that consciousness is connected with our most
      immediate memories. This means that there are limits on what
      consciousness can tell us about itself &mdash; because it can&#39;t do
      perfect self-experiments. That would require keeping perfect records of
      what happens inside one&#39;s memory machinery. But any such machinery
      must get confused by self-experiments that try to find out how it works
      &mdash; since such experiments must change the very records they are
      trying to inspect! We cannot handle interruptions perfectly. This
      doesn&#39;t mean that consciousness cannot be understood, in
      principle. It only means that to study it, we&#39;ll have to use the
      less direct methods of science, because we cannot simply <em>look and
	see.</em></p>
