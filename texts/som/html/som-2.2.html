    <h2><em>2.2</em> Novelists and reductionists</h2>

    <p>
      It&#39;s always best when mysteries can be explained in terms of things
      we know. But when we find this hard to do, we must decide whether to
      keep trying to make old theories work or to discard them and try new
      ones. I think this is partly a matter of personality. Let&#39;s call
      <em>Reductionists</em> those people who prefer to build on old ideas,
      and <em>Novelists</em> the ones who like to champion new hypotheses.
      Reduction- ists are usually right &mdash; at least at science&#39;s
      cautious core, where novelties rarely survive for long. Outside that
      realm, though, novelists reign, since older ideas have had more time to
      show their flaws.</p>

    <p>
      It really is amazing how certain sciences depend upon so few kinds of
      explanations. The science of physics can now explain virtually
      everything we see, at least in principle, in terms of how a very few
      kinds of particles and force-fields interact. Over the past few
      centuries reductionism has been remarkably successful. What makes it
      possible to describe so much of the world in terms of so few basic
      rules? No one knows.</p>

    <p>
      Many scientists look on chemistry and physics as ideal models of what
      psychology should be like. After all, the atoms in the brain are subject
      to the same all-inclusive physical laws that govern every other form of
      matter. Then can we also explain what our brains actually do entirely in
      terms of those same basic principles? The answer is no, simply because
      even if we understood how each of our billions of brain cells works
      separately, this would not tell us how the brain works as an
      agency. The <em>laws of thought</em> depend not only upon the properties
      of those brain cells, but also on how they are connected.  And these
      connections are established not by the basic, general laws of physics,
      but by the particular arrangements of the millions of bits of
      information in our inherited genes. To be sure, general laws apply to
      everything. But, for that very reason, they can rarely explain anything
      in particular.</p>

    <p>
      Does this mean that psychology must reject the laws of physics and find
      its own? Of course not. It is not a matter of different laws, but of
      additional kinds of theories and principles that operate at higher
      levels of organization. Our ideas of how Builder works as an agency need
      not, and must not, conflict with our knowledge of how Builder&#39;s
      lower-level agents work. Each higher level of description must add to
      our knowledge about lower levels, rather than replace it. We&#39;ll
      return to the idea of <em>level</em> at many places in this book.</p>

    <p>
      Will psychology ever resemble any of the sciences that have successfully
      reduced their subjects to only a very few principles?  That depends on
      what you mean by <em>few.</em> In physics, we&#39;re used to
      explanations in terms of perhaps a dozen basic principles. For
      psychology, our explanations will have to combine hundreds of smaller
      theories. To physicists, that number may seem too large. To humanists,
      it may seem too small.</p>
