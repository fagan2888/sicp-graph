    <h2><em>7.9</em> intentions</h2>

    <p>
      When we watch a ball roll down a slope, we notice it seems to
      try to get around obstacles that lie in its path. If we
      didn&#39;t know about gravity, we might be tempted to think that
      the ball has the goal of moving down.  But we know that the ball
      isn&#39;t <em>trying</em> to do anything; the impression of
      intention is only in the watcher&#39;s mind.</p>

    <p>
      When we experiment with Builder we also get the sense that it has a
      goal. Whenever you take its blocks away, it reaches out and takes them
      back. Whenever you knock its tower down, it rebuilds it. It seems to
      want a tower there, and it perseveres until the tower is done. Certainly
      Builder seems smarter than the rolling ball because it overcomes more
      complicated obstacles. But once we know how Builder works, we see that
      it&#39;s not so different from that ball: all it does is keep on finding
      blocks and putting them on top of other blocks. Does Builder really have
      a goal?</p>

    <p>
      One ingredient of having a goal is persistence. We wouldn&#39;t say that
      Builder wants a tower, if it didn&#39;t keep persisting in attempts to
      build one. But persistence alone is not enough &mdash; and neither
      Builder nor that rolling ball have any sense of where they want to
      go. The other critical ingredient of goal is to have some image or
      description of a wanted or desired state. Before we&#39;d agree that
      Builder wants a tower, we&#39;d have to make sure that it contains
      something like an image or a description of a tower. The idea of a
      difference-engine embodies both elements: a representation of some
      outcome and a mechanism to make it persist until that outcome is
      achieved.</p>

    <p>
      Do difference-engines <em>really</em> want? It is futile to ask that
      kind of question because it seeks a distinction where none exists
      &mdash; except in some observer&#39;s mind. We can think of a ball as a
      perfectly passive object that merely reacts to external forces. But the
      eighteenth- century physicist Jean Le Rond d&#39;Alembert showed that
      one can also perfectly predict the behavior of a rolling ball by
      describing it as a difference-engine whose goal is to reduce its own
      energy.  We need not force ourselves to decide questions like whether
      machines can have goals or not. Words should be our servants, not our
      masters. The notion of goal makes it easy to describe certain aspects of
      what people and machines can do; it offers us the opportunity to use
      simple descriptions in terms of active purposes instead of using
      unmanageably cumbersome descriptions of machinery.</p>

    <p>
      To be sure, this doesn&#39;t capture everything that people mean by
      <em>having goals.</em> We humans have so many ways of wanting things
      that no one scheme can embrace them all. Nevertheless, this idea has
      already led to many important developments both in Artificial
      Intelligence and in psychology. The difference-engine scheme remains the
      most useful conception of goal, purpose, or intention yet discovered.</p>
