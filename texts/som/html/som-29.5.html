    <h2><em>29.5</em> the problem of unity</h2>

    <p>
      What makes our minds form many separate mental realms, instead of
      attempting, as scientists do, to see all aspects of the world in a
      unified way? Because, at least in everyday life, the latter simply
      isn&#39;t practical. Consider how different the rules are within the
      physical and social realms. If you want your furniture inside a
      different room, you normally would push it there. But when you want
      to move your party guests, it would be rude to push them
      there. Contrast the principles of physics and geometry with those we
      use in the social realm. In the physical realm, the rules seem very
      orderly:</p>

    <p>
      -- A stationary object stays where it is unless another object
      pushes it.  --- A moving object continues in its course until some
      external force makes it stop.  ----All unsupported objects start to
      fall.</p>

    <p>
      -----No two things can occupy the same location.  -----Etc.</p>

    <p>
      These principles seem clear to us &mdash; but infants cannot
      appreciate them until they&#39;ve built up ways to represent
      ingredients like <em>thing,</em>
      <em>shape,</em> <em>place,</em> <em>move,</em> and <em>near.</em> It
      takes each child many years to develop these abilities.</p>

    <p>
      Our comprehensions of social acts are based on different principles.
      When an ordinary object moves around, we usually see an obvious
      cause; most likely, another object pushed it. But when we see a
      person move, we rarely see the cause at all &mdash; because it&#39;s
      buried in a brain. In predicting how a person will react to an
      expression or gesture, we have little use for physical properties
      like color, shape, or place.  Instead, we employ almost entirely
      different conceptions. To guess the outcome of a social interaction,
      we have to be able to represent each person&#39;s mental state
      &mdash; and to do that, we must develop concepts about traits,
      dispositions, motives, and plans. The concepts that serve so well
      for physical objects are of little help within the social realm
      &mdash; and vice versa.</p>

    <p>
      When normal children start to talk, among the early aspects of their
      speech are words that distinguish animate things. Frequently, a
      child will use a single expression for all kinds of animals, and for
      everything else that can move by itself &mdash; for example, an
      automobile.  According to our view of things, this surely is no
      accident.</p>

    <p>
      To adults, the laws that govern the physical world seem simpler and
      more orderly than those that apply to human events. Does this mean
      that for infants, too, it should be easier first to master the
      physical world and later to proceed toward social and psychological
      understanding? No. Paradoxically, the social realm is initially the
      easier! Imagine that an infant wants a certain toy and that
      there&#39;s a sympathetic person near. The easiest thing is to make
      a request &mdash; that is, a gesture, smile, or cry &mdash; and this
      will probably achieve the goal. It would be far more difficult for
      the infant to coordinate all the complicated machinery for planning
      and executing the trajectory for propelling the object from where it
      is to where the infant wishes it to be. From the point of view of a
      physically helpless infant, the social realm is by far the simpler
      one.</p>
