<h2><em>12.12</em> meaning and definition</h2>

    <p>
      What is a meaning? Sometimes we&#39;re told a definition of a word,
      and suddenly, we know a way to use that word. But definitions do not
      often work so well. Suppose you had to explain what <em>game</em>
      means.  You could start like this:</p>

    <p>
      GAME: An activity in which two teams compete to make a ball do
      something that results in a winning score.</p>

    <p>
      This fits a certain range of games &mdash; but what of games that
      just use words, or keep no scores, or lack the element of
      competition? We can capture the nature of more kinds of games by
      using other definitions, but nothing seems to catch them all. We
      simply cannot find much in common to everything we call a game. Yet
      one still feels there is a certain unity that underlies the idea of
      a game. For example, we feel that we could recognize new games, and
      that <em>game</em> is more than an arbitrary accumulation.</p>

    <p>
      But now let&#39;s turn our attention away from the physical aspects
      of games and focus on the psychological purposes that games can
      serve.  Then it is much easier to find some qualities that are
      common to most adult games:</p>

    <p>
      GAME: An activity that is engaging and diverting, deliberately
      detached from real life.</p>

    <p>
      This second kind of definition treats a game, not as a kind of
      object-thing, but as a process in the mind. At first this might seem
      somewhat strange, but really it is nothing new &mdash; even our
      first definition already contained psychological elements, concealed
      in the words <em>competing</em> and <em>winning.</em> When seen this
      way, different kinds of games seem much more similar. This is
      because they all serve common purposes &mdash; despite the great
      diversity of their physical appearances. After all, there is
      virtually no limit to the variety of physical objects or structures
      that could be used to accomplish the same psychological purpose
      &mdash; in this case, to make an activity diverting (whatever that
      might mean). Naturally, then, it would be hard to specify the range
      of all the possible physical forms of games.</p>

    <p>
      Of course, it is no great surprise to find that <em>game</em> has a
      more psychological character than does <em>brick,</em> which we can
      define in physical terms without referring to our goals. But most
      ideas lie in between. We saw this in the case of <em>chair,</em>
      which we cannot describe without referring both to a physical
      structure and to a psychological function.</p>
