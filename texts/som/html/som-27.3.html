<h2><em>27.3</em> censors</h2>

    <p>
      To see what suppressors and censors have to do, we must consider not
      only the mental states that actually occur, but others that might
      occur under slightly different circumstances.</p>

    <p>
      Suppressors work by interceding to prevent actions just before they
      would be performed. This leads to a certain loss of time, because
      nothing can be done until acceptable alternatives can be found.
      Censors avoid this waste of time by interceding earlier. Instead of
      waiting until an action is about to occur, and then shutting it off,
      a censor operates earlier, when there still remains time to select
      alternatives. Then, instead of blocking the course of thought, the
      censor can merely deflect it into an acceptable
      direction. Accordingly, no time is lost.</p>

    <p>
      Clearly, censors can be more efficient than suppressors, but we have
      to pay a price for this. The farther back we go in time, the larger
      the variety of ways to reach each unwanted state of
      mind. Accordingly, to prevent a particular mental state from
      occurring, an early-acting censor must learn to recognize all the
      states of mind that might precede it. Thus, each censor may, in
      time, require a substantial memory bank. For all we know, each
      person accumulates millions of censor memories, to avoid the
      thought-patterns found to be ineffectual or harmful.</p>

    <p>
      Why not move farther back in time, to deflect those undesired
      actions even earlier? Then intercepting agents could have even
      larger effects with smaller efforts and, by selecting good paths
      early enough, we could solve complex problems without making any
      mistakes at all.  Unfortunately, this cannot be accomplished only by
      using censors.  This is because as we extend a censor&#39;s range
      back into time, the amount of inhibitory memory that would be needed
      (in order to prevent turns in every possible wrong direction) would
      grow exponentially. To solve a complex problem, it is not enough to
      know what might go wrong. One also needs some positive plan.</p>

    <p>
      As I mentioned before, it is easier to notice what your mind does
      than to notice what it doesn&#39;t do, and this means that we
      can&#39;t use introspection to perceive the work of these inhibitory
      agencies. I suspect that this effect has seriously distorted our
      conceptions of psychology and that once we recognize the importance
      of censors and other forms of <em>negative recognizers,</em>
      we&#39;ll find that they constitute large portions of our minds.</p>

    <p>
      Sometimes, though, our censors and suppressors must themselves be
      suppressed. In order to sketch out long-range plans, for example, we
      must adopt a style of thought that clears the mind of trivia and
      sets minor obstacles aside. But that could be very hard to do if too
      many censors remained on the scene; they&#39;d make us shy away from
      strategies that aren&#39;t guaranteed to work, and tear apart our
      sketchy plans before we can start to accomplish them.</p>
