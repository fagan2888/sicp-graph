<h2><em>30.7</em> the myth of the third alternative</h2>

    <p>
      To save our belief in the freedom of will from the fateful grasps of
      Cause and Chance, people simply postulate an empty, third
      alternative. We imagine that somewhere in each person&#39;s mind,
      there lies a Spirit, Will, or Soul, so well concealed that it can
      elude the reach of any law &mdash; or lawless accident.</p>

    <p>
      I&#39;ve drawn the box for Will so small because we&#39;re always
      taking things out of it &mdash; and scarcely ever putting things in!
      This is because whenever we find some scrap of order in the world,
      we have to attribute it to Cause &mdash; and whenever things seem to
      obey no laws at all, we attribute that to Chance. This means that
      the dominion controlled by Will can only hold what, up to now, we
      don&#39;t yet understand. In ancient times, that realm was huge,
      when every planet had its god, and every storm or animal did
      manifest some spirit&#39;s wish. But now for many centuries,
      we&#39;ve had to watch that empire shrink.</p>

    <p>
      Does this mean that we must embrace the modern scientific view and
      put aside the ancient myth of voluntary choice? No. We can&#39;t do
      that: too much of what we think and do revolves around those old
      beliefs. Consider how our social lives depend upon the notion of
      responsibility and how little that idea would mean without our
      belief that personal actions are voluntary. Without that belief, no
      praise or shame could accrue to actions that were caused by Cause,
      nor could we assign any credit or blame to deeds that came about by
      Chance.  What could we make our children learn if neither they nor
      we perceived some fault or virtue anywhere? We also use the idea of
      freedom of will to justify our judgments about good and evil. A
      person can entertain a selfish impulse, yet turn it aside because it
      seems wrong, and that must happen when some self-ideal has
      intervened to overrule another goal. We can feel virtuous when we
      think that we ourselves have chosen to resist an evil
      temptation. But if we suspected that such choices were not made
      freely, but by the interference of some hidden agency, we might very
      well resent that interference. Then we might become impelled to try
      to wreck the precious value-schemes that underlie our personalities
      or become depressed about the futility of a predestination tempered
      only by uncertainty. Such thoughts must be suppressed.</p>

    <p>
      No matter that the physical world provides no room for freedom of
      will: that concept is essential to our models of the mental
      realm. Too much of our psychology is based on it for us to ever give
      it up. We&#39;re virtually forced to maintain that belief, even
      though we know it&#39;s false &mdash; except, of course, when
      we&#39;re inspired to find the flaws in all our beliefs, whatever
      may be the consequence to cheerfulness and mental peace.</p>
