      Let&#39;s redraw our connection line-scheme in the form of three
      layers of agents.</p>

    <p>
      The transmitting-agents can simply be K-lines or memorizers, since
      each of them sends signals to a variety of other agents. The
      receiving-agents can be simple recognizers, since each of them is
      aroused only by certain combinations of connector-agents. However,
      because a typical agent must both arouse other agents and be aroused
      by other agents, it must tend to branch both at its inputs and at
      its outputs. So our network can be drawn to look like this:</p>
    <img class="illus" src="./illus/ch20/20-7.png" class="illus"/>

    <p>
      When we represent the agents this way, we see that they can all be
      simple evidence-weighing agents, only with
      different <em>threshold</em> values. Each recognizer could start out
      with connections to many connector-agents and then, somehow, learn
      to recognize certain signals by altering its connection
      weights. Would it be practical to build learning machines according
      to such a simple scheme? That was the dream of several scientists in
      the 1950s, but none of their experiments worked well enough to
      stimulate further work. Recently, a new type of network machine has
      shown more promise: the so-called Boltzmann machine resembles a
      Perceptron in having an automatic procedure for learning new
      connection weights, but it also has some ability to resolve
      ambiguities by using a variety of
      <em>ring-closing</em> process. The next few years should tell us
      more about such machines. Perhaps they could provide a basis for
      memory- systems that work very much the way K-lines do, to reproduce
      old partial states of mind.</p>

    <p>
      In designing these clever ways to reduce the numbers of connecting
      wires, most researchers have proposed wiring the connections at
      random, so that no signal on any particular wire has any
      significance by itself but represents only a fragment of each of
      many unrelated activities. This has the mathematical advantage of
      producing very few accidental interactions. However, this seems to
      me a bad idea: it would make it very hard for a transmitting-agency
      to learn how to exploit a receiving-agency&#39;s abilities. I
      suspect that when we understand the brain, we&#39;ll discover that
      small groups of connection lines do indeed have local significance
      &mdash; because they will turn out to be the most important agents
      of nearby levels. The connection lines themselves will constitute
      our micronemes!</p>
