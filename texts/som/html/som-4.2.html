    <h2><em>4.2</em> one self or many?</h2>

    <p>
      One common image of the Self suggests that every mind contains some sort
      of Voyeur-Puppeteer inside &mdash; to feel and want and choose for us
      the things we feel, want, and choose. But if we had those kinds of
      Selves, what would be the use of having Minds? And, on the other hand,
      if Minds could do such things themselves, why have Selves? Is this
      concept of a Self of any real use at all? It is indeed &mdash; provided
      that we think of it not as a centralized and all-powerful entity, but as
      a society of ideas that include both our images of what the mind is and
      our ideals about what it ought to be.</p>

    <p>
      Besides, we&#39;re often of two minds about ourselves. Sometimes we
      regard ourselves as single, self-coherent entities. Other times we feel
      decentralized or dispersed, as though we were made of many different
      parts with different tendencies. Contrast these views:</p>

    <p>
      SINGLE-SELF VIEW. <em>I think, I want, I feel. It&#39;s me, myself, who
        thinks my thoughts. It&#39;s not some nameless crowd or cloud of
        selfless parts.</em></p>

    <p>
      MULTIPLE-SELF VIEW. <em>One part of me wants this, another part wants
        that. I must get better control of myself.</em></p>

    <p>
      We&#39;re never wholly satisfied with either view. We all sense feelings
      of disunity, conflicting motives, compulsions, internal tensions, and
      dissensions. We carry on negotiations in our head. We hear scary tales
      in which some person&#39;s mind becomes enslaved by compulsions and
      commands that seem to come from somewhere else. And the times we feel
      most reasonably unified can be just the times that others see us as the
      most confused.</p>

    <p>
      But if there is no single, central, ruling Self inside the mind, what
      makes us feel so sure that one exists? What gives that myth its force
      and strength? A paradox: perhaps it&#39;s because there are no persons
      in our heads to make us do the things we want &mdash; nor even ones to
      make us want to want &mdash; that we construct the myth that we&#39;re
      inside ourselves.</p>
