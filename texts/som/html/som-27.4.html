    <h2><em>27.4</em> exceptions to logic</h2>

    <img class="illus" src="./illus/ch27/27-4.png" class="illus"/>


    <p>
      We spend our lives at learning things, yet always find exceptions
      and mistakes. Certainty seems always out of reach. This means that
      we have to take some risks to keep from being paralyzed by
      cowardice.  But to keep from having accidents, we must accumulate
      two complementary types of knowledge:</p>

    <p>
      We search for <em>islands of consistency</em> within which ordinary
      reasoning seems safe. We work also to find and mark the unsafe
      boundaries of those domains.</p>

    <p>
      In civilized communities, appointed guardians post signs to warn
      about sharp turns, thin ice, and animals that bite. And so do our
      philosophers, when they report to us their paradoxical discoveries
      &mdash; those tales of the Liar who admits to lying and the Barber
      who shaves all the people who do not shave themselves.  These
      valuable lessons teach us which thoughts we shouldn&#39;t think;
      they are the intellectual counterparts to Freud&#39;s emotion
      censors. It is interesting how frequently we find paradoxical
      nonsense to be funny, and when we come to the section on jokes,
      we&#39;ll see why this is so.  When we look closely, we find that
      most jokes are concerned with taboos, injuries, and other ways of
      coming to harm &mdash; and logical absurdities can also lead to
      harm.</p>

    <p>
      We tell our children not to cross the road unless they are sure no
      car is coming. But what do we mean by <em>sure</em>? No one can ever
      really
      <em>prove</em> that no car is coming, since there is no way to rule
      out the possibility that some mad scientist has found a way to make
      cars invisible. In ordinary life we have to deal with <em>usual</em>
      instead of
      <em>true.</em> All we can really ask a child to do is <em>look both
	ways before you cross.</em> In the real world, it makes no sense
      to ask for absolute certainty.</p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately there are no simple, foolproof ways to get around the
      inconsistencies of common sense. Accordingly, we each must learn
      specific ways to keep from various mistakes. Why can&#39;t we do
      that logically? The answer is that perfect logic rarely works. One
      difficulty is finding foolproof rules for reasoning. But the more
      serious problem is that of finding foolproof bases for our
      arguments. It is virtually impossible to state any facts about the
      real world that actually are always true. We observed this when we
      discussed <em>Birds can Fly.</em>  This statement applies to typical
      birds, but not to birds imprisoned in small cages, chained with leg
      irons, or under the influence of high-gravity fields. Similarly,
      when you&#39;re told, <em>Rover is a dog,</em> you&#39;ll assume
      that Rover has a tail, since your frame for a typical dog has a
      terminal for a tail. But should you learn that Rover lacks a tail,
      your mind won&#39;t self-destruct; instead, you&#39;ll change your
      Rover-frame &mdash; but still expect most other dogs to keep their
      tails.</p>

    <p>
      Exceptions are a fact of life because few <em>facts</em> are always
      true.  Logic fails because it tries to find exceptions to this rule.</p>
