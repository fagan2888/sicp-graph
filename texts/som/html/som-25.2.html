      When we first discussed how Builder works, we assumed that it
      employed a vision-agent, See, to locate the various blocks it needs.
      However, we never discussed how See itself might work. A person
      simply <em>looks and sees</em> &mdash; but that&#39;s more
      complicated than it seems.  For instance, even a simple cube looks
      different from each point of view, since as you move, the images it
      makes inside your eye keep changing in both shape and size.</p>

      How strange and dangerous moving would be if every step made
      everything seem wholly new! But that&#39;s not how it seems to
      us. When we move to the right, so that A becomes invisible, we
      remember what we learned when we saw it, and it still seems part of
      what we&#39;re seeing now. How can this be? Here is a theory of why
      things seem to stay the same, even when what we see of them keeps
      changing as we move around.</p>

    <p>
      Frame-Arrays. When we move, our vision-systems switch among a family
      of different frames that all use the same terminals.</p>

    <p>
      I&#39;ll use the term <em>frame-arrays</em> for these groups of
      frames that share the same terminals. When you represent a
      thing&#39;s details with a frame-array, you can continue to move
      around yet <em>keep in mind</em> all that you&#39;ve observed from
      those different viewpoints, even though you&#39;ve never seen them
      all at once. This gives us the wonderful ability to conceive of all
      of an object&#39;s different views as aspects of a single thing.</p>

    <p>
      I do not mean to suggest that every time you see a new object you
      build a brand-new frame-array for it. First, you try to match what
      you see to the frame-arrays in the memories you have accumulated and
      refined over periods of many years. How do frame-arrays originate? I
      would assume that this underlying pattern &mdash; of families of
      frames that all share common terminals &mdash; is built into the
      architectures of major sections of the brain. But although that
      pattern is <em>built in,</em> developing the skills for using it
      involves each child in more than a decade of predestined learning.</p>
