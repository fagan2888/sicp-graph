    <h2><em>6.5</em> Frozen reflection</h2>

    <p>
      No supervisor can know everything that all its agents do. There&#39;s
      simply never time enough. Each bureaucrat sees but a fraction of what
      happens underneath its place in the pyramid of information flow. The
      best subordinates are those that work most quietly. Indeed, that&#39;s
      why we build administrative pyramids for jobs we don&#39;t know how to
      do or don&#39;t have time to do ourselves. It is also why so many of our
      thoughts must hide beyond our consciousness.</p>

    <p>
      Good scientists never try to learn too much at once. Instead, they
      select particular aspects of a situation, observe carefully, and make
      records. Experimental records are <em>frozen phenomena.</em> They let us
      take all the time we need to make our theories. But how could we do the
      same thing inside the mind? We&#39;d need some kind of memory in which
      to keep such records safe.</p>

    <p>
      We&#39;ll see how this could work when we come to the chapters on
      memory. We&#39;ll conjecture that your brain contains a host of agents
      called <em>K-lines,</em> which you can use to make records of what some
      of your brain-agents are doing at a certain moment. Later, when you
      activate the same K-lines, this restores those agents to their previous
      states. This makes you <em>remember</em> part of your previous mental
      state, by making those parts of your mind do just what they did
      before. Then, the other parts of your mind will react as though the same
      events were happening again! Of course, such memories will always be
      incomplete, since nothing could have capacity enough to record every
      detail of its own state. (Otherwise, it would have to be larger than
      itself. ) Since we can&#39;t remember everything, each individual mind
      faces the same problem that scientists always face: they have no
      foolproof way to know, before the fact, what are the most important
      things to notice and record.</p>

    <p>
      Using the mind to examine itself is like science in another way. Just as
      physicists cannot see the atoms they talk about, psychologists can&#39;t
      watch the processes they try to examine. We only <em>know</em> such
      things through their effects. But the problem is worse where the mind is
      concerned, since scientists can read each other&#39;s notes, but
      different parts of the mind can&#39;t read each other&#39;s memories.</p>

    <p>
      We&#39;ve now seen several reasons why we cannot simply watch our minds
      by sitting still and waiting till our vision clears. The only course
      left for us is to study the mind the way scientists do when something is
      too large or small to see &mdash; by building theories based on
      evidence.  Make a guess; test it with a shrewd experiment; collect
      one&#39;s thoughts and guess again. When introspection seems to work,
      it&#39;s not because we&#39;ve found a magic way to see inside
      ourselves. Instead, it means that we&#39;ve done some well-designed
      experiment.</p>
