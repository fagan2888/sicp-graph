    <h2><em>1.3</em> The society of mind</h2>

    <p>
      You know that everything you think and do is thought and done by
      you. But what&#39;s a <em>you</em>? What kinds of smaller entities
      cooperate inside your mind to do your work? To start to see how minds
      are like societies, try this: pick up a cup of tea!</p>

    <p>
      Your GRASPING agents want to keep hold of the cup.  Your BALANCING
      agents want to keep the tea from spilling out.  Your THIRST agents want
      you to drink the tea.  Your MOVING agents want to get the cup to your
      lips.</p>

    <p>
      Yet none of these consume your mind as you roam about the room talking
      to your friends. You scarcely think at all about Balance; Balance has no
      concern with Grasp; Grasp has no interest in Thirst; and Thirst is not
      involved with your social problems. Why not? Because they can depend on
      one another. If each does its own little job, the really big job will
      get done by all of them together: drinking tea.</p>

    <p>
      How many processes are going on, to keep that teacup level in your
      grasp? There must be at least a hundred of them, just to shape your
      wrist and palm and hand. Another thousand muscle systems must work to
      manage all the moving bones and joints that make your body walk
      around. And to keep everything in balance, each of those processes has
      to communicate with some of the others. What if you stumble and start to
      fall? Then many other processes quickly try to get things straight. Some
      of them are concerned with how you lean and where you place your
      feet. Others are occupied with what to do about the tea: you
      wouldn&#39;t want to burn your own hand, but neither would you want to
      scald someone else. You need ways to make quick decisions.</p>

    <p>
      All this happens while you talk, and none of it appears to need much
      thought. But when you come to think of it, neither does your talk
      itself. What kinds of agents choose your words so that you can express
      the things you mean? How do those words get arranged into phrases and
      sentences, each connected to the next? What agencies inside your mind
      keep track of all the things you&#39;ve said &mdash; and, also, whom
      you&#39;ve said them to? How foolish it can make you feel when you
      repeat &mdash; unless you&#39;re sure your audience is new.</p>

    <p>
      We&#39;re always doing several things at once, like planning and walking
      and talking, and this all seems so natural that we take it for granted.
      But these processes actually involve more machinery than anyone can
      understand all at once. So, in the next few sections of this book,
      we&#39;ll focus on just one ordinary activity &mdash; making things with
      children&#39;s building-blocks. First we&#39;ll break this process into
      smaller parts, and then we&#39;ll see how each of them relates to all
      the other parts.</p>

    <p>
      In doing this, we&#39;ll try to imitate how Galileo and Newton learned
      so much by studying the simplest kinds of pendulums and weights, mirrors
      and prisms. Our study of how to build with blocks will be like focusing
      a microscope on the simplest objects we can find, to open up a great and
      unexpected universe. It is the same reason why so many biologists today
      devote more attention to tiny germs and viruses than to magnificent
      lions and tigers. For me and a whole generation of students, the world
      of work with children&#39;s blocks has been the prism and the pendulum
      for studying intelligence.  In science, one can learn the most by
      studying what seems the least.</p>
