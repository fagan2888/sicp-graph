<h2><em>26.12</em> coherent discourse</h2>

    <p>
      Every discourse works on several scales. Each word you hear can
      change your state in a way that depends upon all the structures you
      have built while listening to the words that came before. Most of
      those structures are themselves mere transient things, which persist
      for only a few moments before you rearrange some of their parts and
      perhaps discard the rest entirely. Thus, a car might first appear as
      the subject of a sentence, then become a mere vehicle or instrument
      in the next sentence; finally, the whole scenario might be used
      merely to modify a personal trait of some actor in a larger
      scene. As a discourse proceeds, details on each scale become
      absorbed into larger-scale representation networks whose outlines
      become increasingly remote from the individual words that were used
      to construct them.</p>

    <p>
      It would be wonderful to have a compact, self-contained theory that
      explains all our language-forms. But that ideal cannot be realized
      because words are merely the external signs of very complex
      processes, and there is no clear boundary between language and all
      the rest of what we call thinking. To be sure, the boundaries of
      words themselves are relatively clear, and when they have multiple
      meanings, our grammar-tactics can often help us to assign the proper
      senses to various terminals and other structures. These tactics
      include all sorts of inflections, prepositions, word orderings, and
      signals that indicate how to include one phrase inside another. We
      also combine words into larger expressions that range in vagueness
      of boundaries from compact cliches like <em>hot dog</em> to diffuse
      signals that are scarcely linked to specific words at all; these
      include our hard-to-describe nuances of phrasing, rhythm,
      intonation, and shifts of style and flow.</p>

    <p>
      We&#39;re normally quite unaware of how our grammar-tactics
      constrain us in our choices of words. We&#39;re often somewhat more
      aware of other language-tactics we use to guide our listeners&#39;
      minds &mdash; to change the focus from one theme to another, to
      adjust the levels of detail, to shift between foreground and
      setting. We learn to use phrases like <em>by the way</em> to change
      the topic of concern, to say <em>for example</em> to shift to a
      finer level of detail, to say <em>but</em> to modify an expectation
      or to interrupt the usual flow, or to say <em>in any case</em> or
      <em>in spite of that</em> to indicate the end of an interruption or
      elaboration.</p>

    <p>
      But even all this is only a small part of language. To understand
      what people say, we also exploit our vast stores of common
      knowledge, not only about how specific words are related to the
      subjects of concern, but also about how to express and discuss those
      subjects. Every human community evolves a great array of
      discourse-forms to shape its stories, explanations, conversations,
      discussions, and styles of argument. Just as we learn grammar-forms
      for fitting words to sentence-frames, we also build up stocks
      of <em>plots</em> to organize our story-tales, and standard
      personalities to fill the roles of their protagonists &mdash; and
      every child must learn these forms.</p>
