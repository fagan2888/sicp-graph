    <h2><em>10.6</em> about piaget&#39;s experiments</h2>

    <p>
      Although Piaget&#39;s experiments about conservation of quantity
      have been confirmed as thoroughly as any in psychology, we can
      appreciate why many people are skeptical when they first hear of
      these discoveries. They contradict the traditional assumption that
      children are much like adults, except more ignorant. How strange it
      is that in all the centuries of history, these phenomena went
      unnoticed until Piaget &mdash; as though no one had ever watched a
      child carefully! But it has always been that way with science. Why
      did it take so long for our thinkers to discover such simple ideas
      as Isaac Newton&#39;s laws of motion or Darwin&#39;s idea of natural
      selection? Here are some frequent challenges.</p>

    <p>
      Parent: Couldn&#39;t it be that younger children use words in ways
      that do not mean the same things to adults? Perhaps they simply
      take <em>Which is more?</em> to mean <em>Which is higher?</em> or
      <em>Which is longer?</em></p>

    <p>
      Careful experiments show that this can&#39;t be entirely a matter of
      words. We can offer the same choices, wordlessly, yet most younger
      children will still reach out for taller, thinner jars of orange
      juice or stretched-out rows of candy eggs.</p>

    <p>
      Critic: What happens when Appearance and History conflict? Won&#39;t
      that paralyze your whole Society-of-More?</p>

    <p>
      It would indeed &mdash; unless More has yet other levels and
      alternatives.  And adults have other kinds of explanations &mdash;
      like <em>magic,</em>
      <em>evaporation,</em> or <em>theft.</em> But indeed, stage magicians
      find that making things disappear does not entertain the youngest
      children; presumably they are too used to encountering the
      unexplainable.  What happens when More cannot decide what to do?
      That depends upon the states of other agencies &mdash; including
      those involved in dealing with frustration, restlessness, and
      boredom.</p>

    <p>
      Psychologist: We&#39;ve heard of recent evidence that, despite what
      Piaget said, very young children do have concepts of</p>

    <p>
      quantity; many of them can even count those eggs. Doesn&#39;t that
      refute some of Piaget&#39;s discoveries?
      
      Not necessarily. Consider that no one disputes the outcomes of those
      jar and cup experiments. What is the significance, then, of evidence
      that the young children do possess methods that could give correct
      answers &mdash; and yet they do not use those abilities? As far as I
      can see, such evidence would only further support the need for
      explanations like those of Papert and Piaget.</p>

    <p>
      Biologist: Your theory might explain how some children could acquire
      those concepts about quantities &mdash; but it doesn&#39;t explain
      why all children end up with such similar abilities! Could we be
      born with built-in genes that make brains do this automatically?</p>

    <p>
      This is a profound question. It is hard &mdash; but not impossible
      &mdash; to imagine how genes could directly influence the
      higher-level ideas and conceptions that we eventually
      learn. We&#39;ll discuss this in the appendix at the end of this
      book.</p>
