<h2><em>22.2</em> isonomes</h2>

    <p>
      We introduced the concept of a polyneme to explain how an agent
      could communicate with many other kinds of agencies. In order for a
      polyneme to work, each of its recipients must learn its own way to
      react. Now we&#39;ve seen a second way, for a pronome is also an
      agent that can interact with many other agencies. The difference is
      that a pronome has essentially the same effect on each of its
      recipients &mdash; namely, to activate or to assign a certain
      short-term memory-unit. I&#39;ll introduce a new word
      &mdash; <em>isonome</em> &mdash; for any agent that has this sort of
      uniform effect on many agencies.</p>

    <p>
      An isonome has a similar, built-in effect on each of its
      recipients. It thus applies the same idea to many different things
      at once.
      
      A polyneme has different, learned effects on each of its</p>

    <p>
      recipients. It thus connects the same thing to many different ideas.</p>

    <p>
      Why should isonomes exist at all? Because our agencies have common
      genetic origins, they tend also to be architecturally similar. So
      they&#39;ll tend to lie in roughly parallel formations like the
      pages of a book, operate in generally similar ways, and have similar
      memory-control processes. Then any agent whose connections tend to
      run straight through the pages of that book from cover to cover will
      tend to have similar effects on all of them.</p>

    <p>
      Both isonomes and polynemes are involved with memories &mdash; but
      polynemes are essentially the memories themselves, while isonomes
      control how memories are used. Pronomes are a particular type of
      isonome; there must also be <em>interruption isonomes</em> that work
      similarly but manage memories on larger scales &mdash; for example,
      for storing away the several pronome memories of an entire Trans-
      frame all at once. (We&#39;ll see how something like this must be
      done whenever we encounter a grammar word like <em>who</em>
      or <em>which.</em>) Yet other types of isonomes must be involved
      whenever an agent is used to control the level-band of activity in
      another agency without concern for all the fine details of what
      happens inside that agency. So the power of polynemes stems from how
      they learn to arouse many different processes at once, while
      isonomes draw their power from exploiting abilities that are already
      common to many agencies.</p>
