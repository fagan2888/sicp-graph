<h2><em>26.7</em> frames for nouns</h2>

    <p>
      At various points in their development, most children seem suddenly
      to comprehend new kinds of sentences. Thus, once they learn to deal
      with single adjectives, some children quickly learn to deal with
      longer strings like these:</p>

    <p>
      Dogs bark. Big dogs bark. Big shaggy dogs bark. Big black shaggy
      dogs bark.</p>

    <p>
      If this were done by using word-string sentence-frames, it would
      require a separate frame for each different number of adjectives.
      Another scheme would not use any frames at all but have the
      language-agency convert each adjective, as it arrives, into some
      corresponding neme. And yet another scheme to handle this (still
      popular among some grammar theorists) would have each successive
      adjective arouse a new subframe inside the previous one. However,
      when we look more closely at how people use adjectives, we find that
      these strings are not simple at all. Compare the two phrases below:</p>

    <p>
      The wooden three heavy brown big first boxes . . .  The first three
      big brown heavy wooden boxes . . .</p>

    <p>
      Our language-agents scarcely know what to do with that first string
      of words because it doesn&#39;t fit the patterns we normally use for
      describing things. This suggests that we use framelike structures
      for describing nouns as well as verbs &mdash; that is, for
      describing things as well as actions. To fill the terminals of those
      frames, we expect their ingredients to arrive in a more or less
      definite order. We find it hard to understand a group of English
      adjectives unless they are arranged roughly as shown below.</p>

    <p>
      Whenever a language community can agree on forms like these,
      expression becomes easier. Then every individual can learn, once and
      for all, where to put &mdash; and where to find &mdash; the answers
      to questions most frequently asked. In English one learns to
      say <em>green box,</em> while in French one says <em>box green.</em>
      It doesn&#39;t matter which order is used &mdash; as long as
      everyone agrees to do it the same way. But what are
      the <em>questions most frequently asked</em> &mdash; the ones we
      build into our language-forms? The answer to this is likely to be
      somewhat circular, since the language culture in which we&#39;re
      raised will probably affect the kinds of questions that will seem
      most natural to ask. Still, there could be useful clues in features
      that are common to many different languages.</p>

    <p>
      Many scientists have asked, indeed, why so many human languages use
      similar structures such as nouns, adjectives, verbs, clauses, and
      sentences. It is likely that some of these reflect what is
      genetically built into our language-agencies. But it seems to me
      even more likely that most of these nearly universal language-forms
      scarcely depend on language at all &mdash; but reflect how
      descriptions are formed in other agencies. The most common forms of
      phrases could arise not so much from the architecture of the
      language-agencies as from the machinery used by other agencies for
      representing objects, actions, differences, and purposes &mdash; as
      suggested in section 22.7 &mdash; and from how those other agencies
      manipulate their memories. In short, the ways we think must have a
      strong and universal influence on how we speak &mdash; if only
      through its influence on the sorts of things we&#39;ll want to say.</p>
