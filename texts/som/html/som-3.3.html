    <h2><em>3.3</em> hierarchies</h2>
    <blockquote class="dictionary">
      <b>bu&bullet;reauc&prime;ra&bullet;cy</b> <i>n.</i> the
      administration of government through departments and
      subdivisions managed by sets of officials following an
      inflexible routine.

    <p>
      As an agent, Builder does no physical work but merely turns on Begin,
      Add, and End. Similarly, Add just orders Find, Put, and Get to do their
      jobs. Then these divide into agents like Move and Grasp. It seems that
      it will never stop &mdash; this breaking-down to smaller things.</p>

    <p>
      Eventually, it all must end with agents that do actual work, but there
      are many steps before we get to all the little muscle-motor agents that
      actually move the arms and hands and finger joints. Thus Builder is like
      a high-level executive, far removed from those subordinates who actually
      produce the final product.</p>

    <p>
      Does this mean that Builder&#39;s administrative work is unimportant?
      Not at all. Those lower-level agents need to be controlled. It&#39;s
      much the same in human affairs. When any enterprise becomes too complex
      and large for one person to do, we construct organizations in which
      certain agents are concerned, not with the final result, but only with
      what some other agents do. Designing any society, be it human or
      mechanical, involves decisions like these:</p>

    <p>
      Which agents choose which others to do what jobs?  Who will decide which
      jobs are done at all?  Who decides what efforts to expend?  How will
      conflicts be settled?</p>

    <p>
      How much of ordinary human thought has Builder&#39; s character? The
      Builder we described is not much like a human supervisor. It doesn&#39;t
      decide which agents to assign to which jobs, because that has already
      been arranged. It doesn&#39;t plan its future work but simply carries
      out fixed steps until End says the job is done. Nor has it any
      repertoire of ways to deal with unexpected accidents.</p>

    <p>
      Because our little mental agents are so limited, we should not try to
      extend very far the analogy between them and human supervisors and
      workers. Furthermore, as we&#39;ll shortly see, the relations between
      mental agents are not always strictly hierarchical. And in any case,
      such roles are always relative. To Builder, Add is a subordinate, but to
      Find, Add is a boss. As for yourself, it all depends on how you live.
      Which sorts of thoughts concern you most &mdash; the orders you are made
      to take or those you&#39;re being forced to give?</p>
