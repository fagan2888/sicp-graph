    <p>
      We&#39;ve all heard jokes about how stupid present-day computers are.
      They send us bills and checks for zero dollars and zero cents. They
      don&#39;t mind working in endless loops, repeating the same thing a
      billion times. Their total lack of common sense is another reason people
      think that no machine could have a mind.</p>

    <p>
      It is interesting to note that some of the earliest computer programs
      excelled at what people consider to be <em>expert</em> skills. A 1956
      program solved hard problems in mathematical logic, and a 1961 program
      solved college-level problems in calculus. Yet not till the 1970s could
      we construct robot programs that could see and move well enough to
      arrange children&#39;s building-blocks into simple towers and
      playhouses.  Why could we make programs do grown-up things before we
      could make them do childish things? The answer may seem paradoxical:
      much of <em>expert</em> adult thinking is actually simpler than what is
      involved when ordinary children play! Why is it easier to program what
      experts do than what children do?</p>

    <p>
      What people vaguely call common sense is actually more intricate than
      most of the technical expertise we admire. Neither that <em>expert</em>
      program for logic nor the one for calculus embodied more than a hundred
      or so <em>facts</em> &mdash; and most of them were rather similar to one
      another. Yet these were enough to solve college-level problems. In
      contrast, think of all the different kinds of things a child must know
      merely to build a house of blocks &mdash; a process that involves
      knowledge of shapes and colors, space and time, support and balance, and
      an ability to keep track of what one is doing.</p>

    <p>
      To be considered an <em>expert,</em> one needs a large amount of
      knowledge of only a relatively few varieties. In contrast, an ordinary
      person&#39;s <em>common sense</em> involves a much larger variety of
      different types of knowledge &mdash; and this requires more complicated
      management systems.</p>

    <p>
      There is a simple reason why it is easier to acquire specialized
      knowledge than commonsense knowledge. Each type of knowledge needs some
      form of <em>representation</em> and a body of skills adapted to using
      that style of representation. Once that investment has been made, it is
      relatively easy for a specialist to accumulate further knowledge,
      provided the additional expertise is uniform enough to suit the same
      style of representation. A lawyer, doctor, architect, or composer who
      has learned to deal with a range of cases in some particular field finds
      it relatively easy to acquire more knowledge of a similar
      character. Think how much longer it would take a single person to learn
      to deal competently with a few diseases and several kinds of law cases
      and a small variety of architectural blueprints and a few orchestral
      scores. The greater variety of representations would make it much harder
      to acquire the <em>same amount</em> of knowledge. For each new domain,
      our novice would have to learn another type of representation and new
      skills for using it. It would be like learning many different languages,
      each with its own grammar, lexicon, and idioms. When seen this way, what
      children do seems all the more remarkable, since so many of their
      actions are based upon their own inventions and discoveries.</p>
