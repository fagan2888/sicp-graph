<h2><em>12.9</em> the exception principle</h2>

    <p>
      What should one do with a law or rule that doesn&#39;t always work?
      We saw one way when we developed our uniframe for the Block-Arch. We
      simply kept changing it to fit each new example. But what if, after
      all that work, there still remain exceptions that don&#39;t fit?</p>

    <p>
      The Exception Principle: It rarely pays to tamper with a rule that
      nearly always works. It&#39;s better just to complement it with an
      accumulation of specific exceptions.</p>

    <p>
      All children learn that birds can fly and that animals that swim are
      fish. So what should they do when told that penguins and ostriches
      are birds that cannot fly, or that whales and porpoises are animals
      that swim but aren&#39;t fish? What should the children do with
      uniframes that no longer work so well? The exception principle says:
      Do not change them too hastily. We should never expect rules to be
      perfect but only to say what is typical. And if we try to modify
      each rule, to take each exception into account, our descriptions
      will become too cumbersome to use. It&#39;s not so bad to start
      with <em>Birds can fly</em> and later change it into <em>Birds can
	fly, unless they are penguins or ostriches.</em> But if you continue
      to seek perfection, your rules will turn into monstrosities:</p>

    <p>
      Birds can fly, unless they are penguins and ostriches, or if they
      happen to be dead, or have broken wings, or are confined to cages,
      or have their feet stuck in cement, or have undergone experiences so
      dreadful as to render them psychologically incapable of flight.</p>

    <p>
      Unless we treat exceptions separately, they&#39;ll wreck all the
      generalizations we may try to make. Consider why the commonsense
      idea of fish is so useful. It is an accumulation of general
      information about a class of things that have much in common:
      animals that live in the water, have a certain sort of streamlined
      shape, and move by wriggling their bodies and fanning the water with
      various finlike appendages. However, a biologist&#39;s idea of fish
      is very different, being more involved with the origins and internal
      mechanisms of those animals. This leads to emphasizing aspects less
      evident to the eye: if whales have lungs where trout have gills,
      they must be uniframed in different ways. Children are disturbed to
      hear that whales are not fish because they are usually more
      concerned with uses and appearances than with origins and
      mechanisms. They&#39;re more likely to want classifications like
      these:</p>

    <p>
      What do those animals do? Where do they live? Are they easy to
      catch? Are they dangerous? Are they useful? What do they eat? How do
      they taste?</p>

    <p>
      The power of ordinary words like <em>fish</em> comes from how we
      make them span so many meaning-worlds at once. However, in order to
      do this, we have to be able to tolerate many exceptions. We almost
      never find rules that have no exceptions &mdash; except in certain
      special, artificial worlds that we ourselves create by making up
      their rules and regulations to begin with. Artificial realms like
      mathematics and theology are built from the start to be devoid of
      interesting inconsistency. But we must be careful not to mistake our
      own inventions for natural phenomena we have discovered. To insist
      on perfect laws in real life is to risk not finding any laws at
      all. Only in the sciences, where every exception must be explained,
      does it make sense to pay that price.</p>
