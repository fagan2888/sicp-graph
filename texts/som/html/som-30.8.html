<h2><em>30.8</em> intelligence and resourcefulness</h2>

    <p>
      How could anything as complex as a human mind work so well for so
      many years? We all appreciate those splendid feats of writing plays
      and symphonies. But we rarely recognize how wonderful it is that a
      person can traverse an entire lifetime without making a single
      really serious mistake &mdash; like putting a fork in one&#39;s eye
      or using a window instead of a door. How do we do such amazing feats
      as to imagine things we&#39;ve never seen before, to overcome
      obstacles, to repair things that are broken, to speak to one
      another, to have new ideas?  What magical trick makes us
      intelligent? The trick is that there is no trick. The power of
      intelligence stems from our vast diversity, not from any single,
      perfect principle. Our species has evolved many effective although
      imperfect methods, and each of us individually develops more on our
      own. Eventually, very few of our actions and decisions come to
      depend on any single mechanism. Instead, they emerge from conflicts
      and negotiations among societies of processes that constantly
      challenge one another. In this book we&#39;ve seen many such
      dimensions of diversity:</p>

    <p>
      The accumulation of myriad subagents.  We learn many different ways
      to achieve each kind of goal.  The many realms of ordinary thought.
      When one viewpoint fails to solve a problem, we can adopt other
      perspectives.  The endowment of several <em>instinctive</em>
      protominds.  We embody different kinds of organizations for
      achieving many kinds of goals.  The hierarchies of administration
      grown in accord with Papert&#39;s principle.  When simple methods
      fail, we can build new levels of organization.  The evolutionary
      vestiges of animals that still remain inside our brains.  We use
      machinery evolved from fish, amphibia, reptiles, and earlier
      mammals.  The sequence of stages of the growing child&#39;s
      personality.  We accumulate different personalities that we can
      apply to</p>

    <p>
      different situations.  The complex, ever-growing heritage of
      language and culture.  We can use methods and ideas developed by
      millions of our ancestors.  The subordination of thought processes
      to censors and suppressors.  We do not need perfect methods, since
      we can remember how imperfect methods fail.</p>

    <p>
      Each of these dimensions gives you toughness and versatility. They
      offer alternative ways to proceed when any system fails. If part of
      your society of mind proposes to do what other parts find
      unacceptable, your agencies can usually find another way. Sometimes
      you merely need to turn to another branch of the same accumulation.
      When that fails, you can ascend to a higher level and engage a
      larger change in strategy. Then, even if an entire agency should
      fail, your brain retains earlier versions of it. This means that
      every facet of your personality may have the option
      to <em>regress</em> to an earlier stage, which already has proved
      itself competent to deal with the usual problems of life. Finally,
      when even that won&#39;t work, you can usually switch to an entirely
      different family of agencies. Whenever anything goes wrong, there
      are always other realms of thought.</p>
