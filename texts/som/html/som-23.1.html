    <h2><em>23.1</em> a world of differences</h2>


    <p>
      Much of ordinary thought is based on recognizing differences. This
      is because it is generally useless to do anything that has no
      discernible effect. To ask if something is significant is virtually
      to ask, <em>What difference does it make?</em> Indeed, whenever we
      talk about <em>cause and effect</em> we&#39;re referring to
      imaginary links that connect the differences we sense. What, indeed,
      are goals themselves, but ways in which we represent the kinds of
      changes we might like to make?</p>

    <p>
      It is interesting how many familiar mental activities can be
      represented in terms of the differences between situations. Suppose
      you have in mind two situations A and Z, and D is your description
      of the difference between them. Suppose also that you are thinking
      of applying a certain procedure P to the first situation, A. There
      are several kinds of thinking you might do.</p>

    <p>
      PREDICTING. To the extent that you can predict how various P&#39;s
      will affect A, you can avoid the expense and risk of actually
      performing those actions.</p>

    <p>
      EXPECTING. If you expect P to produce Z but it actually produces Y,
      then you can try to explain what went wrong in terms of difference
      between Y and Z.
      
      EXPLAINING. If actions like P usually lead to differences of type D,
      then when you observe such a D, you can suspect that it was caused
      by something like P.</p>

    <p>
      WANTING. If you are in situation A, but wish to be in a situation
      more like Z, it may help to remember ways to remove or reduce
      differences like D.
      
      ESCAPING, ATTACKING, and DEFENDING. If P causes a disturbing type of
      difference D, we can try to improve matters by finding some action
      that counteracts or opposes P.
      
      ABSTRACTING. In many forms of thought, the differences we notice
      between objects at each level become the <em>objects</em> of our
      higher-level thoughts.</p>

    <p>
      Not only are differences important by themselves; more often than we
      realize, we think about differences between differences. For
      example, the <em>height</em> of a physical object is really a
      difference between the locations of its top and its bottom. And this
      means that the higher-level agents in our Societies-of-More must
      actually deal with differences between differences. For example, the
      agent Taller has to react to the difference between two heights
      &mdash; but as we&#39;ve just seen, a height is already a difference
      between two locations!</p>

    <p>
      The ability to consider differences between differences is important
      because it lies at the heart of our abilities to solve new
      problems. This is because these <em>second-order-differences</em>
      are what we use to remind ourselves of other problems we already
      know how to solve.  Sometimes this is called <em>reasoning by
	analogy</em> and is considered to be an exotic or unusual way to
      solve problems. But in my view, it&#39;s our most ordinary way of
      doing things.</p>
