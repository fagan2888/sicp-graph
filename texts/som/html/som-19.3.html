    <p>
      How does an insubstantial word like <em>apple</em> lead you to think
      of a real thing &mdash; an object of a certain size that is red,
      round, sweet, and has a shiny, thin-peeled skin? How could a plain
      acoustic sound produce such complex states of mind, involving all
      those qualities of color, substance, taste, and shape? Presumably,
      each different quality involves a different agency. But then &mdash;
      in view of all we&#39;ve said about why different agents can&#39;t
      communicate &mdash; how could such varying recipients
      all <em>understand</em> the selfsame messages? Do language- agents
      have unusual abilities to communicate with different kinds of
      agencies?</p>

    <p>
      Many people have tried to explain language as though it were
      separate from the rest of psychology. Indeed, the study of language
      itself was often divided into smaller subjects, called by
      traditional names like syntax, grammar, and semantics. But because
      there was no larger, coherent theory of thinking to which to attach
      those fragments, they tended to lose contact with one another and
      with reality. Once we assume that language and thought are different
      things, we&#39;re lost in trying to piece together what was never
      separate in the first place. This is why, in the following pages,
      I&#39;ll put aside most of the old language theories and return to
      the questions that led to them:</p>

    <p>
      How are words involved with mental processes?  How does language
      enable people to communicate?</p>

    <p>
      In the next few sections, we&#39;ll introduce two kinds of agents
      that contribute to the power of words. The first kind,
      called <em>polynemes,</em> are involved with our long-term
      memories. A polyneme is a type of K-line; it sends the same, simple
      signal to many different agencies: each of those agencies must
      learn, for itself, what to do when it receives that signal. When you
      hear the word <em>apple,</em> a certain polyneme is aroused, and the
      signal from this polyneme will put your Color agency into a state
      that represents redness. The same signal will set your Shape agency
      into a state that represents roundness, and so forth.  Thus, the
      polyneme for <em>apple</em> is really very simple; it knows nothing
      whatever about apples, colors, shapes, or anything else. It is
      merely a switch that turns on processes in other agencies, each of
      which has learned to respond in its own way.</p>

    <p>
      Later we&#39;ll discuss another type of language-agent that
      we&#39;ll call an
      <em>isonome.</em> Each isonome controls a short-term memory in each
      of many agencies. For example, suppose we had just been talking
      about a certain apple, and then I said, <em>Please put it in this
	pail.</em> In this case, you would assume that the word <em>it</em>
      refers to the apple. However, if we had been discussing your left
      shoe, you would assume <em>it</em> referred to that shoe. A word
      like <em>it</em> excites an isonome whose signal has no particular
      significance by itself, but controls what various agencies do with
      certain recent memories.</p>
