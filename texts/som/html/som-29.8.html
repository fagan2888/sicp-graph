<h2><em>29.8</em> metaphors</h2>

    <p>
      Listen closely to anything anyone says, and soon you&#39;ll hear
      analogies.  We speak of time in terms of space, as like a fluid
      that&#39;s running out; we talk of our friends in physical terms, as
      in <em>Mary and John are very close.</em> All of our language is
      riddled and stitched with curious ways of portraying things as
      though they belonged to alien realms.</p>

    <p>
      We sometimes call these <em>metaphors,</em> our ways to transport
      thoughts between the various mental realms. Some metaphors seem
      utterly pedestrian, as when we speak of <em>taking steps</em> to
      cause or prevent some happening. Other metaphors seem more
      miraculous, when unexpected images lead to astonishing insights
      &mdash; as when a scientist solves a problem by conceiving of a
      fluid as made of tubes or of a wave as an array of overlapping,
      expanding spheres. When such conceptions play important roles in our
      most productive forms of thought, we find it natural to
      ask, <em>What is a metaphor?</em> But we rarely notice how
      frequently we use the same techniques in ordinary thought.</p>

    <p>
      What, then, is a metaphor? It might be easy to agree on functional
      definitions like <em>A metaphor is that which allows us to replace
	one kind of thought with another.</em> But when we ask for a
      structural definition of
      <em>metaphor,</em> we find no unity, only an endless variety of
      processes and strategies. Some are simple, as when we make an
      analogy by stripping away so many details that two different objects
      seem the same. But other forms of metaphor are as complex as can
      be. In the end there is little to gain by cloaking them all under
      the same name
      <em>metaphor,</em> because there isn&#39;t any boundary between
      metaphorical thought and ordinary thought. No two things or mental
      states ever are identical, so every psychological process must
      employ one means or another to induce the illusion of
      sameness. Every thought is to some degree a metaphor.</p>

    <p>
      Once scientists like Volta and Ampere discovered how to represent
      electricity in terms of the pressures and flows of fluids, they
      could transport much of what they already knew about fluids to the
      domain of electricity. Good metaphors are useful because they
      transport uniframes, intact, from one world into another. Such
      cross-realm correspondences can enable us to transport entire
      families of problems into other realms, in which we can apply to
      them some already well-developed skills. However, such
      correspondences are hard to find since most reformulations merely
      transform the uniframes of one realm into disorderly accumulations
      in the other realm.</p>

    <p>
      From where do we obtain our most productive, systematic, cross-
      realm correspondences? Some must be virtually born into our brains
      through the wiring of our paranomes; other metaphors we discover by
      ourselves as individuals; but most of them are learned from other
      members of our cultural communities. Finally, from time to time,
      someone discovers a new reformulation that is both so fruitful and
      so easy to explain that it becomes part of the general
      culture. Naturally, we&#39;d like to know how the greatest
      metaphorical discoveries were made. But because this is buried in
      the past, the best and rarest of those events may never be explained
      at all. Our greatest ideas, like our evolutionary genes, need form
      only once, by accident, and then can spread from brain to brain.</p>
