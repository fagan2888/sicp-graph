    <h2><em>8.2</em> re-membering</h2>

    <p>
      Suppose once, long ago, you solved a certain problem P. Some of your
      agents were active then; others were quiet. Now let&#39;s suppose
      that a certain <em>learning process</em> caused the agents that were
      active then to become attached to a certain agent kP, which
      we&#39;ll call a K-line. If you ever activate kP afterward, it will
      turn on just the agents that were active then, when you first solved
      that problem P!</p>

    <p>
      Today you have a different problem. Your mind is in a new state,
      with agents Q aroused. Something in your mind suspects that Q is
      similar to P &mdash; and activates kP.</p>
    <img class="illus" src="./illus/ch8/8-2.png" class="illus"/>
    <p>
      Now two sets of agents are active in your mind at once: the Q-agents
      of your recent thoughts and the P-agents aroused by that old
      memory. If everything goes well, perhaps both sets of agents will
      work together to solve today&#39;s problem. And that&#39;s our
      simplest concept of what memories are and how they&#39;re formed.</p>

    <p>
      What happens if the now active agents get into conflicts with those
      the K-line tries to activate? One policy might be to give priority
      to the K-line&#39;s agents. But we wouldn&#39;t want our memories to
      rearouse old states of mind so strongly that they overwhelm our
      present thoughts &mdash; for then we might lose track of what
      we&#39;re thinking now and wipe out all the work we&#39;ve done. We
      only want some hints, suggestions, and ideas. Another policy would
      give the presently active agents priority over the remembered ones,
      and yet another policy would suppress both, according to the
      principle of noncompromise.  This diagram shows what happens for
      each of these policies if we assume that neighboring agents tend to
      get into conflicts:</p>

    <p>
      The ideal scheme would activate exactly those P &#39;s that would be
      most helpful in solving the present problem. But that would be too
      much to ask of any simple strategy.</p>
