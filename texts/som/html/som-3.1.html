    <p>
      Most children not only like to build, they also like to knock things
      down.  So let&#39;s imagine another agent called Wrecker, whose
      specialty is knocking-down. Our child loves to hear the complicated
      noises and watch so many things move all at once.</p>
    <img class="illus" src="./illus/ch3/3-1.png"/>
    <p>
      Suppose Wrecker gets aroused, but there&#39;s nothing in sight to smash.
      Then Wrecker will have to get some help &mdash; by putting Builder to
      work, for example. But what if, at some later time, Wrecker considers
      the tower to be high enough to smash, while Builder wants to make it
      taller still? Who could settle that dispute?</p>

    <p>
      The simplest policy would be to leave that decision to Wrecker, who was
      responsible for activating Builder in the first place. But in a more
      realistic picture of a child&#39;s mind, such choices would depend on
      many other agencies. For example, let&#39;s assume that both Builder and
      Wrecker were originally activated by a higher-level agent,
      Play-with-Blocks.  Then, a conflict might arise if Builder and Wrecker
      disagree about whether the tower is high enough.</p>
	<img class="illus" src="./illus/ch3/3-2.png"/>

    <p>
      What aroused Play-with-Blocks in the first place? Perhaps some even
      higher-level agent, Play, was active first. Then, inside Play, the agent
      Play-with-Blocks achieved control, in spite of two competitors,
      Play-with-Dolls and Play-with-Animals. But even Play itself, their
      mutual superior-in-chief, must have had to compete with other
      higher-level agencies like Eat and Sleep. For, after all, a child&#39;s
      play is not an isolated thing but always happens in the context of other
      real-life concerns. Whatever we may choose to do, there are always other
      things we&#39;d also like to do.</p>

    <p>
      In several sections of this book, I will assume that conflicts between
      agents tend to migrate upward to higher levels. For example, any
      prolonged conflict between Builder and Wrecker will tend to weaken their
      mutual superior, Play-with-Blocks. In turn, this will reduce
      Play-with-Blocks&#39; ability to suppress its rivals, Play-with-Dolls
      and Play-with-Animals. Next, if that conflict isn&#39;t settled soon, it
      will weaken the agent Play at the next-higher level. Then Eat or Sleep
      might seize control.</p>
