<h2><em>30.4</em> world models</h2>

    <p>
      Now let&#39;s look at Mary&#39;s model of the
      world. (By <em>world</em> I mean the universe, not just the planet
      Earth.) This is simply all the structures in Mary&#39;s head that
      Mary&#39;s agencies can use to answer questions about things in the
      world.</p>

    <p>
      But what if we were to ask Mary a question not about any particular
      object, but one like <em>What sort of thing is the world
	itself?</em> That would put Mary in a curious predicament. She
      cannot answer this by using her world model, because each part of
      that model is designed only to answer questions about particular
      things. The trouble is that the world itself is not a particular
      thing inside the world.</p>

    <p>
      One way to deal with this (and a method that, surely, many children
      use) is adding to the model of the world an
      additional <em>object</em> &mdash; that represents the world
      itself. Then, since any object must have properties, the child might
      then assign to this the features, say, of an extremely large
      ball. Naturally this will lead to trouble should that child persist
      in asking ordinary questions about this extraordinary object &mdash;
      such as <em>What keeps the universe in place?</em> or
      <em>What&#39;s outside the universe?</em> &mdash; for these then
      lead to strange and inconsistent images. Eventually we learn some
      ways to deal with this &mdash; for example, by learning which
      questions to suppress. But as in the case of a perfect point, we may
      always feel uncomfortable with the thought of a thing that is
      unimaginably large in size, but has no shape at all.</p>

    <p>
      When you get right down to it, you can never really describe any
      worldly thing, either &mdash; that is, in any absolute
      sense. Whatever you purport to say about a thing, you&#39;re only
      expressing your own beliefs. Yet even that gloomy thought suggests
      an insight. Even if our models of the world cannot yield good
      answers about the world as a whole, and even though their other
      answers are frequently wrong, they can tell us something about
      ourselves. We can regard what we learn about our models of the world
      as constituting our models of our models of the world.</p>
