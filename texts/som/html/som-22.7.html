<h2><em>22.7</em> causes and clauses</h2>

    <p>
      For virtually every change we see, we tend to seek some cause. And
      when we find no cause on the scene, we&#39;ll postulate that one
      exists, even though we might be wrong. We do this so consistently
      that I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to find that brains have built-in
      tendencies to try to represent all situations in certain special
      ways:</p>

    <p>
      THINGS. Whatever we may see or touch, we represent the scene in
      terms of separate object-things. We do the same for representing
      processes and mental states. In languages, these object-symbols tend
      to correspond to nouns.
      
      DIFFERENCES. Whenever we discern a change or just compare two
      different things, we represent this as a difference thing. In
      languages, these often correspond to verbs.</p>

    <p>
      CAUSES. Whenever we conceive of an action, change, or difference, we
      try to assign a cause to it &mdash; that is, some other person,
      process, or thing that we can hold to be responsible for it. In
      languages, causes often take the forms of things.
      
      CLAUSES. Whatever structures we conceive are dealt with like single
      things. In languages, this corresponds to treating an entire phrase
      as though it were a single word.</p>

    <p>
      In English, almost every sentence form demands some sort of Actor
      noun &mdash; and I think this reflects the need to find a motive or
      a cause.  Consider how we place that it in <em>Soon it will begin to
	rain.</em> We&#39;re always chopping complex situations into
      artificially clear-cut chunks which we perceive as separate
      things. Then we notice various differences and relationships among
      those parts and assign them to various parts of speech. We string
      our words into clauses and our clauses into chains, often
      interrupting one by inserting fragments of others inside it, yet
      proceeding as though there were no interruptions at all. It has been
      alleged that the construction of such structures is unique to the
      grammar-machinery of language, but I suspect that languages evolved
      those forms because of mechanisms deeper in the grain of how we
      think. For example, when we talked about visual ambiguity, we saw
      that our vision-systems are highly proficient at representing
      structures that interrupt one another. This suggests that both our
      visual and linguistic abilities to deal with <em>interruptions</em>
      could be based on similar methods with which we <em>manage</em> what
      is represented in our short-term memories.</p>

    <p>
      In any case, our brains appear to make us seek to represent
      dependencies. Whatever happens, where or when, we&#39;re prone to
      wonder who or what&#39;s responsible. This leads us to discover
      explanations that we might not otherwise imagine, and that helps us
      predict and control not only what happens in the world, but also
      what happens in our minds. But what if those same tendencies should
      lead us to imagine things and causes that do not exist? Then
      we&#39;ll invent false gods and superstitions and see their hand in
      every chance coincidence. Indeed, perhaps that strange
      word <em>I</em> &mdash; as used in <em>I just had a good idea</em>
      &mdash; reflects the selfsame tendency. If you&#39;re compelled to
      find some cause that causes everything you do &mdash; why, then,
      that something needs a name. You call it <em>me.</em> I call
      it <em>you.</em></p>
