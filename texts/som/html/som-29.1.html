    <h2><em>29.1</em> the realms of thought</h2>


    <p>
      Our view of the body and the mind as separate entities is only one
      example of our many ways to view the world as divided into different
      realms. Imagine that a committee were commissioned to write down
      everything about the universe in a perfectly organized book.</p>

    <p>
      Why do the gaps between the lines seem smaller than those that
      separate the pages? It is because we better understand what happens
      in between. We understand how walls relate to bricks because they
      represent closely related <em>levels of organization.</em>
      Similarly, we understand the relation between houses and walls. But
      it would be hard to cross the gap between houses and bricks without
      having enough intermediate concepts such as that of a wall. It
      simply isn&#39;t practical to think of the place where someone lives
      as a network of relationships among a million boards and bricks.</p>

    <p>
      It&#39;s much the same in other realms; we need to be able to
      describe things at many levels of detail. We all belong to families
      or companies, and sometimes we can think of each group
      as <em>nothing but</em> a network of agreements and
      relationships. But when we need a larger view, as when thinking
      about the politics of an entire country, we cannot think effectively
      without regarding entire families or companies as though they were
      single objects in a different realm.  The same applies to how we
      think about our minds. Even if you knew all the details of each
      little agent in your brain, your higher-level processes would still
      need coarser summaries.</p>

    <p>
      Why is it easier to understand how walls relate to bricks, or
      families to individuals, than to understand how thoughts relate to
      things? It&#39;s not because there&#39;s any single mystery. It is
      because the level gap between walls and bricks is really much
      smaller than that between minds and brain cells. Suppose we actually
      had that wonderful encyclopedia of <em>all possible knowledge,</em>
      arranged according to the nearness of topics. There we&#39;d find
      the essays on walls quite close to those about bricks. But the
      sections that cover the nature of thoughts would lie volumes away
      from the ones on the nature of things.</p>
