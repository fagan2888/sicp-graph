    <h2><em>7.3</em> the puzzle principle</h2>

    <p>
      Many people reason that machines do only what they&#39;re programmed to
      do &mdash; and hence can never be creative or original. The trouble is
      that this argument presumes what it purports to show: that you can&#39;t
      program a machine to be creative! In fact, it is surprisingly easy to
      program a computer so that it will proceed to do more different things
      than any programmer could imagine in advance. This is possible because
      of what we&#39;ll call the <em>puzzle principle.</em></p>

    <p>
      Puzzle Principle: We can program a computer to solve any problem by
      trial and error, without knowing how to solve it in advance, provided
      only that we have a way to recognize when the problem is solved.</p>

    <p>
      By <em>trial and error</em> we mean programming the machine
      systematically to generate all possible structures within some universe
      of possibilities. For example, suppose you wished to have a robot
      machine that could build a bridge across a stream. The most efficient
      program for this would simply execute a specific procedure, planned out
      in advance, to precisely place some boards and nails. Of course, you
      couldn&#39;t write such a program unless you already knew how to build a
      bridge. But consider the alternative below, which is sometimes called
      the generate and test method. It consists of writing a two-part program.</p>

    <p>
      Generate. The first process simply produces, one after another, every
      possible arrangement of the boards and nails. At first, you might expect
      such a program to be hard to write. But it turns out to be surprisingly
      easy, once you appreciate that there is no requirement for each
      arrangement to make any sense whatsoever!
      
      Test. The second part of the process examines each arrangement to see
      whether the problem has been solved. If the goal were to build a dam,
      the test is simply whether it holds back the stream. If the goal were to
      build a bridge, the test is simply whether it spans the stream.</p>

    <p>
      This possibility makes us reexamine all our old ideas about intelligence
      and creativity, since it means that, in principle, at least, we can make
      machines solve any problems whose solutions we can recognize. This is
      rarely practical, however. Consider that there must be a thousand ways
      to attach two boards, a million ways to connect three of them, and a
      billion ways to nail four boards together. It would take inconceivably
      long before the puzzle principle produced a workable bridge. But it does
      help, philosophically, to replace our feeling of mystery about
      creativity by more specific and concrete questions about the efficiency
      of processes. The main problem with our bridge-building machine is the
      lack of connection between its generator and its test.  Without some
      notion of progress toward a goal, it is hard to do better than mindless
      chance.</p>
