<h2><em>15.5</em> the immanence illusion</h2>

 <blockquote>
Everyone will readily allow that there is a considerable difference
between the perceptions of the mind, when a man feels the pain of
excessive heat, or the pleasure of moderate warmth, and when he
afterwards recalls to his memory this sensation, or anticipates it by
his imagination. These faculties may mimic or copy the perceptions of
the senses; but they never can entirely reach the force and vivacity
of the original sentiment&hellip;The most lively thought is still
inferior to the dullest sensation.
      <cite>&mdash;Marcel proust</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      We like to think of memories as though they could restore to us
      things we&#39;ve known in the past. But memories can&#39;t really
      bring things back; they only reproduce some fragments of our former
      states of mind, when various sights, sounds, touches, smells, and
      tastes affected us.</p>

    <p>
      Then what makes some recollections seem so real? The secret is that
      real-time experience is just as indirect! The closest we can come to
      apprehending the world, in any case, is through the descriptions our
      agents make. In fact, if we inquired instead about why real things
      seem real, we would see that this depends, as well, on memories of
      things we&#39;ve already known.</p>

    <p>
      For instance, when you see a telephone, you have a sense not only of
      the aspects you can see &mdash; its color, texture, size, and shape
      &mdash; but also of how it feels to hold the instrument to your
      ear. You also seem to know at once what telephones are for: that you
      speak into here and listen there; that when it rings you answer it;
      that when you want to call, you dial it. You have a sense of what it
      weighs, of whether it is soft or hard, of what its other side is
      like &mdash; although you haven&#39;t even touched it yet. These
      apprehensions come from memories.</p>

    <p>
      The Immanence Illusion: Whenever you can answer a question without a
      noticeable delay, it seems as though that answer were already active
      in your mind.</p>

    <p>
      This is part of why we feel that what we see is <em>present</em> in
      the here and now. But it isn&#39;t really true that whenever a real
      object appears before our eyes, its full description is instantly
      available. Our sense of momentary mental time is flawed; our
      vision-agencies begin arousing memories before their own work is
      fully done. For example, when you see a horse, a preliminary
      recognition of its general shape may lead some vision-agents to
      start evoking memories about horses before the other vision-agents
      have discerned its head or tail. Perceptions can evoke our memories
      so quickly that we can&#39;t distinguish what we&#39;ve seen from
      what we&#39;ve been led to recollect.</p>

    <p>
      This explains some of the subjective difference between seeing and
      remembering. If you first imagined a black telephone, you probably
      would not find it hard to reimagine it as red. But when you see a
      black telephone and then attempt to think of it as red, your
      vision-systems swiftly change it back! So the experience of seeing
      things has a relatively rigid character, in contrast to the
      experience of imagining things. Every change that the rest of your
      mind tries to impose upon your vision-agencies is resisted and
      usually reversed. Perhaps it is this descriptive rigidity that we
      identify with <em>vividness</em> or <em>objectivity.</em> I do not
      mean to suggest that this is usually an illusion, because it often
      truly reflects the persistency and permanence of actual physical
      objects.  Sometimes, though, our sense of objectivity can get
      reversed &mdash; as when an attitude or memory becomes more stable
      and persistent than what it represents. For example, our attitudes
      toward things we love or loathe are often much less changeable than
      those things themselves &mdash; particularly in the case of other
      people&#39;s personalities. In instances like these, our private
      memories can be more rigid than reality.</p>
