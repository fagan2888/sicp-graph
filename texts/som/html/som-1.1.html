<h2><em>1.1</em> The agents of the mind</h2>

    <p>
      Good theories of the mind must span at least three different scales of
      time: slow, for the billion years in which our brains have evolved;
      fast, for the fleeting weeks and months of infancy and childhood; and in
      between, the centuries of growth of our ideas through history.</p>

    <p>
      To explain the mind, we have to show how minds are built from mindless
      stuff, from parts that are much smaller and simpler than anything
      we&#39;d consider smart. Unless we can explain the mind in terms of
      things that have no thoughts or feelings of their own, we&#39;ll only
      have gone around in a circle. But what could those simpler particles be
      &mdash; the <em>agents</em> that compose our minds? This is the subject
      of our book, and knowing this, let&#39;s see our task. There are many
      questions to answer.</p>

    <p>
      Function: How do agents work?  Embodiment: What are they made of?
      Interaction: How do they communicate?  Origins: Where do the first
      agents come from?  Heredity: Are we all born with the same agents?
      Learning: How do we make new agents and change old ones?  Character:
      What are the most important kinds of agents?  Authority: What happens
      when agents disagree?  Intention: How could such networks want or wish?
      Competence: How can groups of agents do what separate agents cannot do?
      Selfness: What gives them unity or personality?  Meaning: How could they
      understand anything?  Sensibility: How could they have feelings and
      emotions?  Awareness: How could they be conscious or self-aware?</p>

    <p>
      How could a theory of the mind explain so many things, when every
      separate question seems too hard to answer by itself? These questions
      all seem difficult, indeed, when we sever each one&#39;s connections to
      the other ones. But once we see the mind as a society of agents, each
      answer will illuminate the rest.</p>
