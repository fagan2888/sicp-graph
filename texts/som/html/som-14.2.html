<h2><em>14.2</em> means and ends</h2>

    <p>
      How do we connect the things we have with the goals we want to
      achieve? The answer: We have many ways! Each use or purpose may
      suggest some corresponding way to split things up &mdash; and in
      each such view there will seem to be some <em>most essential</em>
      parts. These are the ones that, in such a view, appear to serve the
      goal directly; the rest will seem like secondary parts that only
      support the role of the main parts. We do this not only in the
      physical realm, but in many other realms as well.</p>

    <p>
      Each of these dumbbell distinctions has its own style for
      distinguishing essential parts from supportive parts. And even in
      the world of physical things, we can apply these different mental
      views in different ways. For example, there are many ways to
      describe the act of standing on a table in order to be able to reach
      higher.</p>
   

    <table class="duplex">
      <tr><td>Support:</td><td>Tables hold things away from the floor.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Function:</td><td>Tables
      are for supporting things.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Conclusion:</td><td>If you put something on a
      table, its height increases.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Cause-Effect:</td><td>I can reach higher
      because I start higher.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Means-Ends:</td><td>If I want to reach higher, I
      can stand on a table.</td></tr>

      Support: Tables hold things away from the floor.  Function: Tables
      are for supporting things.  Conclusion: If you put something on a
      table, its height increases.  Cause-Effect: I can reach higher
      because I start higher.  Means-Ends: If I want to reach higher, I
      can stand on a table.</p>

    <p!-->
      Even when we simply put something on a table, we&#39;re likely to
      employ several such descriptions at the same time &mdash; perhaps in
      different sections of the mind. The quality of our understanding
      depends upon how well we move between those different realms. In
      order to translate easily from one of them to another, we must
      discover systematic cross-realm correspondences. However, finding
      these is rare. Usually, the situation is like that we found for
      chairs and games: each description-element in one world corresponds
      to a hard-to- describe accumulation of structures in the other
      world. What is remarkable about the body-support concept is how
      often it leads to systematic cross-realm correspondences. For
      example, we can use it to translate <em>supported by,</em> in the
      architectural realm, into <em>horizontal surface underneath</em> in
      the geometrical realm. To be sure, this correspondence fails to
      represent the possibility of supporting an object by suspending it
      from above. But some exceptions are inevitable.</p>

    <p>
      Our systematic cross-realm translations are the roots of fruitful
      metaphors; they enable us to understand things we&#39;ve never seen
      before. When something seems entirely new in one of our
      description-worlds, it may turn out that when translated to some
      other world it resembles something we already know.</p>

    <p>
      Now, before you turn to the following page, try to solve this
      puzzle.</p>
