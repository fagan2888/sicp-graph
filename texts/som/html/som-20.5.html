<h2><em>20.5</em> micronemes</h2>

    <p>
      That old idea of classifying things by properties is not entirely
      satisfactory, because so many kinds of qualities interact in
      complicated ways. Every situation or condition we experience is
      influenced or, so to speak, colored, by thousands of contextual
      shades and hues, just as looking through a tinted glass has faint
      effects on everything we see.</p>

    <p>
      material: animate, inanimate; natural, artificial; ideal, actual
      perceptual: color, texture, taste, sound, temperature solidity:
      hardness, density, flexibility, strength shape: angularity,
      curvature, symmetry, verticality permanence: rarity, age, fragility,
      replaceability location: office, home, vehicle, theater, city,
      forest, farm environment: indoors, outdoors; public, private</p>

    <p>
      activity: hunting, gambling, working, entertaining relationship:
      cooperation, conflict; negotiating, confronting security: safety,
      danger; refuge, exposure; escape, defeat Some of these conditions
      and relationships may correspond to language-words, but for most of
      them we have no words, just as we have no expressions for most
      flavors and aromas, gestures and intonations, attitudes and
      dispositions. I&#39;ll call them
      <em>micronemes</em> &mdash; those inner mental context clues that
      shade our minds&#39; activities in ways we can rarely express. There
      is a somewhat different microstructure to each person&#39;s
      thoughts; indeed, their inexpressibility reflects our
      individuality. Nevertheless, we can clarify our image of the mind by
      envisioning these unknown influences as embodied in the forms of
      particular agents.  Accordingly, in the next few sections, we&#39;ll
      envision our micronemes as K-lines that reach into many agencies
      with widespread effects on the arousal and suppression of other
      agents &mdash; including other micronemes. These micronemes
      participate in all those <em>locking-in</em>
      and <em>weeding-out</em> processes, so that, for example, the
      activity of your microneme for <em>outdoors</em> makes a small
      contribution to arousing your <em>hunting</em> microneme. While each
      such effect may be relatively small, the effects of activating many
      micronemes will usually combine to establish a context within which
      most words are understood unambiguously.</p>

    <p>
      For example, in one context the word <em>Boston</em> might bring to
      mind some thoughts about the American Revolution. In a different
      setting, the same word might lead one to think instead of a
      geographic location. Other contexts might yield thoughts about
      famous universities, sporting teams, life-styles, accents of speech,
      or traditional meals. Each of these concepts must be represented by
      a certain network of agents that are connected, directly or
      indirectly, to the word-agent for Boston. But hearing or thinking
      that word by itself is not enough to determine which of those
      word-sense networks to activate; this must also depend upon other
      aspects of the present context. Our hypothesis is that this comes
      about principally through each word-sense agent learning to
      recognize the activation of certain combinations of micronemes.</p>

    <p>
      Even modest families of micronemes could span vast ranges of
      contexts. A mere forty independent micronemes could specify a
      trillion different contexts &mdash; and we surely have thousands,
      and perhaps millions of different micronemes.</p>
