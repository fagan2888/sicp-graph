    <h2><em>6.8</em> thinking without thinking</h2>

    <p>
      Just as we walk without thinking, we think without thinking! We
      don&#39;t know how our muscles make us walk &mdash; nor do we
      know much more about the agencies that do our mental work. When
      you have a hard problem to solve, you think about it for a
      time. Then, perhaps, the answer seems to come all at once, and
      you say, <em>Aha, I&#39;ve got it. I&#39;ll do such and
      such.</em> But if someone were to ask how you found the
      solution, you could rarely say more than things like the
      following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>I suddenly realized . . .</li>
      <li>I just got this idea . . .</li>
      <li>It occurred to me that . . .</li></ul>

    <p>
      If we could really sense the workings of our minds, we wouldn&#39;t act
      so often in accord with motives we don&#39;t suspect. We wouldn&#39;t
      have such varied and conflicting theories for psychology. And when
      we&#39;re asked how people get their good ideas, we wouldn&#39;t be
      reduced to metaphors about <em>ruminating,</em>
      and <em>digesting,</em> <em>conceiving</em> and
      <em>giving birth</em> to concepts &mdash; as though our thoughts were
      anywhere but in the head. If we could see inside our minds, we&#39;d
      surely have more useful things to say.</p>

    <p>
      Many people seem absolutely certain that no computer could ever
      be sentient, conscious, self-willed, or in any other
      way <em>aware</em> of itself.  But what makes everyone so sure
      that they themselves possess those admirable qualities? It&#39;s
      true that if we&#39;re sure of anything at all, it is
      that <em>I&#39;m aware &mdash; hence I&#39;m aware.</em> Yet
      what do such convictions really mean? If self-awareness means to
      know what&#39;s happening inside one&#39;s mind, no realist
      could maintain for long that people have much insight, in the
      literal sense of seeing-in. Indeed, the evidence that we are
      self-aware &mdash; that is, that we have any special aptitude
      for finding out what&#39;s happening inside ourselves &mdash; is
      very weak indeed.  It is true that certain people have a special
      excellence at assessing the attitudes and motivations of other
      persons (and, more rarely, of themselves). But this does not
      justify the belief that how we learn things about people,
      including ourselves, is fundamentally different from how we
      learn about other things. Most of the understandings we
      call <em>insights</em> are merely variants of our other ways
      to <em>figure out</em> what&#39;s happening.</p>
