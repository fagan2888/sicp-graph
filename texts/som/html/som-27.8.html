<h2><em>27.8</em> good humor</h2>

    <p>
      Some readers might object that the censor-learning theory of jokes
      is too narrow to be an explanation of humor in general. What of all
      the other roles that humor plays in occasions of enjoyment and
      companionship? Our answer is the same as usual: we can&#39;t expect
      any single, simple theory to explain adult psychology. To ask how
      humor works in a grown-up person is to ask how everything works in a
      grown-up person, since humor gets involved with so many other
      things. I didn&#39;t mean to suggest that every aspect of humor is
      involved in making censors learn. When humor evolved, as when any
      other mechanism develops in biology, it must have been built upon
      other mechanisms that already existed, and embodied mixtures of
      those other functions. Just as the voice is used for many social
      purposes, the mechanisms involved in humor are also used for other
      effects that are less involved with memory. In later life the effect
      of <em>functional autonomy</em> can make it hard to recognize the
      original function not only of humor, but of many other aspects of
      adult psychology. To understand how feelings work, we need to
      understand both their evolutionary and their individual histories.</p>

    <p>
      We&#39;ve seen how important it is for us to learn about
      mistakes. To keep from making old mistakes ourselves, we learn about
      them from our families and friends. But a peculiar problem arises
      when we tell another person that something is wrong, for if this is
      interpreted as an expression of disapproval and rejection, it can
      evoke a sense of pain and loss &mdash; and lead to withdrawal and
      avoidance. Accordingly, to point out mistakes to someone whose
      loyalty and love we want to keep, we must adopt some pleasant or
      conciliatory form. Thus humor has evolved its graciously disarming
      ways to do its basically distasteful job! You don&#39;t want the
      recipient to <em>kill the messenger who brings bad news</em> &mdash;
      especially when you&#39;re the messenger.</p>

    <p>
      Many people seem genuinely surprised when shown that humor is so
      concerned with unpleasant, painful, and disgusting subjects. In a
      certain sense, there&#39;s really nothing humorous about most jokes
      &mdash; except, perhaps, in the skill and subtlety with which their
      dreadful content is disguised; frequently, the thought itself is
      little more than <em>See what happened to somebody else; now,
	aren&#39;t you glad it wasn&#39;t you?</em> In this sense most jokes
      are not actually frivolous at all but reflect the most serious of
      concerns. Why, by the way, are jokes usually less funny when heard
      again? Because the censors learn some more each time and prepare to
      act more quickly and effectively.</p>

    <p>
      Why, then, do certain kinds of jokes, particularly those about
      forbidden sexual subjects, seem to remain persistently funny to so
      many people? Why do those censors remain unchanged for so long?
      Here we can reuse our explanation of the prolonged persistence of
      attachment, infatuation, sexuality, and mourning-grief; because
      these areas relate to self-ideals, their memories, once formed, are
      slow to change. Thus the peculiar robustness of sexual humor may
      mean only that the censors of human sexuality are among the <em>slow
	learners</em> of the mind, like retarded children. In fact, we could
      argue that they literally are retarded children &mdash; that is,
      they are among the frozen remnants of our earlier selves.</p>
