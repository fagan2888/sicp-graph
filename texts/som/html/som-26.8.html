<h2><em>26.8</em> frames for verbs</h2>

    <p>
      We&#39;ve seen how a four-word sentence such as <em>Round squares
	steal honestly</em> could be made to fit a certain four-terminal
      frame. But what about a sentence like <em>The thief who took the
	moon moved it to Paris</em>? It would be dreadful if we had to
      learn a new and special ten-word frame for each particular type of
      ten-word string! Clearly we don&#39;t do any such thing. Instead,
      we use the pronoun <em>who</em> to make the listener find and fill
      a second frame. This suggests a multistage theory. In the earliest
      stages of learning to speak, we simply fill the terminals of
      word-string frames with nemes for words. Then, later, we learn to
      fill those terminals with other filled-in language-frames.  For
      example, we can describe our moon sentence as based on a top-level
      Trans-frame for <em>move</em> whose Actor terminal contains a
      second Trans-frame for <em>took</em>:</p>

    <p>
      Using frames this way simplifies the job of learning to speak by
      reducing the number of different kinds of frames we have to learn.
      But it makes language learning harder, too, because we have to learn
      to work with several frames at once.</p>

    <p>
      How do we know which terminals to fill with which words? It
      isn&#39;t so hard to deal with <em>red, round, thin-peeled
	fruit,</em> since each such property involves a different
      agency. But that won&#39;t work for <em>Mary loves Jack,</em>
      since <em>Jack loves Mary</em> has the very same words, and only
      their order indicates their different roles. Each child must learn
      how the order of words affects which terminal each phrase should
      fill. As it happens, English applies the same policy both
      to <em>Mary loves Jack</em> and to our moon sentence:</p>

    <p>
      Assign the Actor pronome to the phrase before the verb.  Assign the
      Object pronome to the phrase after the verb.</p>

    <p>
      The policies for assigning phrases to pronomes vary from one
      language to another. The word order for Actor and Object is less
      constrained in Latin than in English, because in Latin those roles
      can be specified by altering the nouns themselves. In both languages
      we often indicate which words should be assigned to other pronome
      roles by using specific prepositions like <em>for,</em> <em>by,</em>
      and <em>with.</em> In many cases, different verb types use the same
      prepositions to indicate the use of different pronomes. At first
      such usages may seem to be arbitrary, but they frequently encode
      important systematic metaphors; in section 21.2 we saw
      how <em>from</em> and <em>to</em> are used to make analogies between
      space and time. How did our language- forms evolve? We have no
      record of their earliest forms,</p>

    <p>
      but they surely were affected at every stage by the kinds of
      questions and problems that seemed important at the time. The
      features of present-day languages may still contain some clues about
      our ancestors&#39; concerns.</p>
