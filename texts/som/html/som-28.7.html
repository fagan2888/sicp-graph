<h2><em>28.7</em> individual identities</h2>

    <p>
      Suppose I had once borrowed your boat and, secretly, replaced each
      board with a similar but different one. Then, later, when I brought
      it back, did I return your boat to you? What kind of question is
      that?  It&#39;s really not about boats at all, but about what people
      mean by
      <em>same.</em> For <em>same</em> is never absolute but always a
      matter of degree. If I had merely changed one plank, we&#39;d all
      agree that it&#39;s still your boat &mdash; but after all its parts
      are changed, we&#39;re not so sure of its identity. In any case, we
      do not doubt that the second boat will behave in much the same way
      &mdash; to the extent that all those substituted boards are suitably
      equivalent.</p>

    <p>
      What has this to do with brains? Well, now suppose that we could
      replace each of your brain cells with a specially designed computer
      chip that performs the same functions, and then suppose that we
      interconnect these devices just as your brain cells are
      connected. If we put it in the same environment, this new machine
      would reproduce the same processes as those within your brain. Would
      that new machine be the same as you? Again, the real question is not
      what we mean by
      <em>you,</em> but what we mean by <em>same.</em> There isn&#39;t any
      reason to doubt that the substitute machine would think and feel the
      same kinds of thoughts and feelings that you do &mdash; since it
      embodies all the same processes and memories. Indeed, it would
      surely be disposed to declare, with all your own intensity, that it
      is you. Would that machine be right or wrong? As far as I can see,
      this, too, is merely a matter of words. A mind is a way in which
      each state gives rise to the state that follows it. If that new
      machine had a suitable body and were placed in a similar
      environment, its sequence of thoughts would be essentially the same
      as yours &mdash; since its mental states would be equivalent to
      yours.</p>

    <p>
      Modifying or replacing the physical parts of a brain will not affect
      the mind it embodies, unless this alters the successions of states
      in that brain.</p>

    <p>
      You might object to this idea about duplicating minds on the grounds
      that it would never be practical to duplicate enough details. You
      could argue the same about that borrowed boat: no matter how
      carefully a carpenter were to copy every board, there would always
      remain some differences. This plank would be a little too stiff,
      that one would be a little too weak, and no two of them would bend
      in exactly the same way. The copied boat would never be precisely
      the same &mdash; even though you might need a microscope to see the
      differences. For similar reasons, it would be impractical to
      duplicate, with absolute fidelity, all the interactions in a
      brain. For example, our brain cells are all immersed in a liquid
      that conducts electricity, which means that every cell has at least
      a small effect on every other cell. If we tried to imitate your
      brain with a network of computer chips, many of those tiny
      interactions would be left out.</p>

    <p>
      Can you then boast that your duplicated brain-machine would not have
      the same mind as yours because its computer chips don&#39;t work
      exactly like the brain cells they purport to replace? No; you&#39;d
      get more than you bargained for if you argued that the new machine
      was not the same as you, merely because of microscopic
      differences. Consider that as you age, you&#39;re never the same as
      a moment ago. If such small differences matter that much, this would
      prove that you yourself are not the same as you.</p>
