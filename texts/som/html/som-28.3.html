<h2><em>28.3</em> quantity and quality</h2>

    <p>
      We&#39;ve scarcely mentioned at all inside this book the kinds of
      quantities that could be <em>measured</em> &mdash; though surely
      brain cells use them all the time. For example, it seems quite
      likely that many of our agents employ quantitative schemes for
      summarizing evidence or establishing the strengths of
      connections. But I have said little about such matters because I
      suspect that such matters play diminished roles, the more we move
      toward higher-level operations of the mind.  This is because
      whenever we&#39;re forced to compare magnitudes, we have to pay a
      heavy price: it tends to terminate what we call
      <em>thinking.</em></p>

    <p>
      Whenever we turn to measurements, we forfeit some uses of
      intellect. Currencies and magnitudes help us make comparisons only
      by concealing the differences among what they purport to represent.</p>

    <p>
      By their nature, quantitative descriptions are so one-dimensional
      and featureless that they cannot help but conceal the structures
      that give rise to them. This is inescapable, since any act that
      makes two different things comparable must do it by deflecting our
      attention from their differences. Numbers themselves are the
      greatest masters of disguise because they perfectly conceal all
      traces of their origins.  Add five and eight to make thirteen, and
      tell that answer to a friend: thirteen will be all your friend can
      know, since no amount of ingenious thought can ever show that it
      came from adding five and eight! It&#39;s much the same inside the
      head: quantitative judgments help us make decisions only by keeping
      us from thinking too much about the actual evidence.</p>

    <p>
      No matter that such judgments have faults; you often have no choice
      but to choose. This happens when you can&#39;t stay where you are
      and must turn either right or left. Somewhere in some agencies,
      alternatives must be compared &mdash; and sometimes one can find no
      way except by using currencies. Then, various agents in your brain
      may turn to whatever quantities &mdash; chemical, electrical, or
      whatever &mdash; that happen to be available. Any substance or
      quantity whose availability is limited can be made to serve as a
      currency. But when we make our theories about how such systems work,
      we simply must remember not to make the easy mistake of confusing
      those quantities with their adopted functions and thus, for example,
      believing that certain drugs are inherently <em>stimulating</em>
      or <em>depressing,</em> or that certain foodstuffs are inherently
      more <em>natural,</em> or more <em>healthy.</em> Most of the
      properties of a currency are not inherent &mdash; but merely
      conventional.</p>

    <p>
      In any case, we should never assume that the quality or character of
      a thought process depends directly on the nature of the
      circumstances that evoke it. There is no quality
      of <em>sweetness</em> inherent in sugar itself, which is a mere
      chemical. Its quality of sweetness is, in effect, a currency
      involved with certain agencies that are connected to sensors that
      detect the presence of sugar.  Those agencies evolved that way
      because whenever we have hunger goals, it pays to recognize the
      taste of sugar as a <em>sign of success</em> &mdash; simply because
      sugar itself supplies energy, is easy to detect, and usually
      indicates the presence of other edible sources of
      nutrition. Similarly, inside our brains, many agencies have come to
      influence one another by controlling the amounts of various
      chemicals in much the way that many kinds of human transactions have
      come to use substances like candy, coins, or bags of salt &mdash; or
      banknotes backed by promises.</p>
