    <h2><em>19.1</em> the roots of intention</h2>

    <blockquote>
      The wind blows where it will, and you hear the sound of it, but you do
      not know whence it comes or whither it goes; so it is with every one
      who is born of the Spirit.

    <p>
      Language builds things in our minds. Yet words themselves can&#39;t
      be the substance of our thoughts. They have no meanings by
      themselves; they&#39;re only special sorts of marks or sounds. If
      we&#39;re to understand how language works, we must discard the
      usual view that words denote or represent, or designate; instead,
      their function is control: each word makes various agents change
      what various other agents do. If we want to understand how language
      works, we must never forget that our thinking-in-words reveals only
      a fragment of the mind&#39;s activity.</p>

    <p>
      We often seem to think in words. Yet we do this with no conscious
      sense of where and why those words originate or how they then
      proceed to influence our further thoughts and what we subsequently
      do. Our inner monologues and dialogues proceed without any effort,
      deliberation, or sense of how they&#39;re done. Now you might argue
      that you do know what brings those words to mind &mdash; in the
      sense that they are how you
      <em>express</em> your intentions and ideas. But that amounts to the
      same thing &mdash; since your intentions, too, appear to come and go
      in ways you do not understand. Suppose, for example, that at a
      certain moment you find you want to leave the room. Then, naturally,
      you&#39;d look for the door. And this involves two mysteries:</p>

    <p>
      What made you want to leave the room? Was it simply that you became
      tired of staying in that room? Was it because you remembered
      something else you had to do? Whatever reasons come to mind, you
      still must ask what led to them. The further back you trace your
      thoughts, the vaguer seem those causal chains.</p>

    <p>
      The other side of the mystery is that we are equally ignorant of</p>

    <p>
      how we respond to our own intentions. Given a desire to leave the
      room, what led you to the thought of <em>door</em>? You only know
      that first you thought, <em>It&#39;s time to go,</em> and then you
      thought,
      <em>Where is the door?</em></p>

    <p>
      We&#39;re all so used to this that we regard it as completely
      natural. Yet we have barely any sense of why each thought follows
      the last. What connects the idea of leaving with the idea of door?
      Does this result from some direct connection between two partial
      states of mind, of leaving and of door? Does it involve some sort of
      less direct connection, not between those states themselves, but
      only between some signals that somehow represent those states? Or is
      it the product of yet more complex mechanisms?</p>

    <p>
      Our introspective abilities are too weak to answer such questions.
      The words we think seem to hover in some insubstantial interface
      wherein we understand neither the origins of the symbol-signs that
      seem to express our desires nor the destinations wherein they lead
      to actions and accomplishments. This is why words and images seem so
      magical: they work without our knowing how or why. At one moment a
      word can seem enormously meaningful; at the next moment it can seem
      no more than a sequence of sounds. And this is as it should be.  It
      is the underlying emptiness of words that gives them their potential
      versatility. The less there is in a treasure chest, the more
      you&#39;ll be able to put in it.</p>
