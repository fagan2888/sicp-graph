    <h2><em>17.3</em> attachment simplifies</h2>

    <blockquote>
      No form of behavior is accompanied by stronger feeling than is
      attachment behavior. The figures towards whom it is directed are
      loved and their advent is treated with joy. So long as a child
      is in the unchallenged presence of a principal
      attachment-figure, or within easy reach, he feels secure. A
      threat of loss creates anxiety, and actuall loss, sorrow; both,
      moreover, are likely to arouse anger.
     <cite>&mdash;John Bowlby</cite>

    <p>
      Most higher animals have evolved instinctive <em>bonding</em>
      mechanisms that keep the youngsters close to the parents. Human
      infants, too, are born with tendencies to form special attachments;
      all parents know their powerful effects. Early in life, most
      children become attached to one or a few family members or
      caretakers, sometimes so firmly that for several years such children
      may never stray more than a few meters from the
      attachment-figure. During those years, a prolonged separation of the
      child from those particular persons may be followed by an enduring
      depression or disturbance, during which the child&#39;s personality
      does not develop normally.</p>

    <p>
      What is the function of childhood attachment? The simplest
      explanation is that it evolved to keep children within a safe sphere
      of nurture and protection. But according to our theory, our human
      bond machinery has the additional function of forcing children to
      acquire values, goals, and ideals from particular older
      individuals. Why is this so important? Because even though there are
      many ways a child could learn about ordinary causes and effects,
      there is no way for a child to construct a coherent system of values
      &mdash; except by basing it upon some already existing model. The
      task of constructing a <em>civilized personality</em> must be far
      beyond the inventive power of any single individual. Furthermore, if
      too wide a variety of adult models were available, it would be too
      hard to build a coherent personality of one&#39;s own, because one
      would have to pick and choose fragments from all those different
      personalities &mdash; and this might lead to so many conflicts and
      inconsistencies that many of them would cancel each other out. It
      would simplify the child&#39;s task if the attachment mechanism
      restricted attention to only a few role models.</p>

    <p>
      How did our attachment-bonds evolve? In many species of animals,
      attachment occurs so swiftly and firmly that scientists who study
      animal behavior call it <em>imprinting.</em> Presumably, the
      machinery that makes us learn our parents&#39; goals is descended
      from the mechanisms of our animal ancestors. Presumably our
      infantile attachment-bonds form as soon as various inborn systems
      learn to distinguish the parents&#39; individual peculiarities
      &mdash; first by senses of touch, taste, and smell; then by sound of
      voice and, finally, by sight of face.</p>

    <p>
      Once those attachment-bonds are formed, a child won&#39;t react in
      the same way to the faces and voices of strangers and parents, for
      these have different effects on how we learn. The effect of an
      attachment-person&#39;s affection or rejection is not like that of
      ordinary
      <em>success-failure</em> goal-rewards &mdash; which merely teach us
      what to do in order to achieve our goals. Attachment-related signals
      seem to work directly on those goals themselves &mdash; and thus can
      modify our personalities. Attachments teach us ends, not means
      &mdash; and thus impose on us our parents&#39; dreams.</p>
