    <h2><em>8.6</em> levels</h2>

    <p>
      We sometimes think of memory as though it could transport us back to
      hear the voices of times gone by and see the sights of the past. But
      memory can&#39;t really take us anywhere; it can only recall our
      minds to prior states, to visit what we used to be, by putting back
      what was in the mind before. We introduced the level-band theory to
      provide a way for a memory to encompass some range or <em>level</em>
      of detail of descriptions, as when, in remembering that kite
      experience, certain aspects were recorded firmly and others weakly
      or not at all. The concept of a level-band can be applied not only
      to descriptions of things, but also to our memories of the processes
      and activities we use in order to achieve our goals &mdash; that is,
      the mental states we re-create that once solved problems in the
      past. The problems we have to solve change with time, so we must
      adapt our old memories to our present goals. To see how level-bands
      can help with that, let&#39;s now return to Play-with-Blocks &mdash;
      but this time let&#39;s suppose that our child has grown to maturity
      and wants to build a real house. Which agents from the old
      building-society can still be applied to this new problem?</p>

    <p>
      The new house-building agency can certainly use many of Tower
      Builder&#39;s skills. It certainly will need Add&#39;s lower-level
      skills like Find and Get and Put. But House Builder won&#39;t have
      so much use for Tower Builder&#39;s highest-level agents like Begin
      and End &mdash; because these were specialized for making
      towers. Nor will it have much use for Builder&#39;s lowest-level
      skills, like those in Grasp, because picking up such small blocks
      isn&#39;t the problem. But most of the skills embodied in
      Builder&#39;s middle level-bands will still apply. These seem to
      embody the sort of knowledge that is most broadly and generally
      useful, whereas uppermost and lowest level-bands are more likely to
      be based on aspects of the problem that are specific to an older
      goal or to the particular details of the original problem. But if
      our memory machinery has been designed so that the contents of those
      distant fringes can be easily detached, the extra knowledge stored
      in them will rarely do much harm and can often be helpful. For
      example, Tower Builder&#39;s fringe details could tell us what to do
      in case our house should grow very tall or require a high chimney.</p>

    <p>
      We started out by using level-bands for describing things &mdash;
      but we ended up using them for doing things! In the next few
      sections we&#39;ll see that it is no accident that level-related
      ideas play many different roles in how we think.</p>
