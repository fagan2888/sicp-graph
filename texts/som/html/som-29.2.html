    <h2><em>29.2</em> several thoughts at once</h2>

    <p>
      To see that we can think in several mental realms at once, consider
      the role of the word <em>give</em> in this simple sentence:</p>

    <p>
      Mary gives Jack the kite.</p>

    <p>
      We can see at least three distinct meanings here. First, we could
      represent the idea of the kite&#39;s motion through physical space
      by using a Trans-frame whose Trajectory begins at Mary&#39;s hand
      and ends at Jack&#39;s.</p>

    <p>
    </p>

    <p>
      But quite beyond that realm of space, we also find a different
      significance in what Mary did &mdash; in another realm that
      we&#39;ll call</p>

    <p>
      <em>estates.</em> This involves a different sense of <em>give,</em>
      in which the object need not actually move at all! Instead, what
      happens is the transfer of its ownership.</p>

    <p>
      Each of us has an <em>estate</em> &mdash; the collection of
      possessions we control.  And this <em>realm of estate</em> is more
      important than it might seem, because it lies between the realms of
      objects and ideas. In order to carry out our plans, it is not enough
      only to know what things or ideas are required and how to adapt them
      to our purposes. We must also be able to take possession of those
      objects or ideas, either by right or by might.</p>

    <p>
      Possession plays essential roles in all our plans, because we
      can&#39;t use any materials, tools, or ideas until we gain control
      of them.</p>

    <p>
      We can also interpret Mary&#39;s act within a social realm, in which
      we understand that giving gifts involves yet other kinds of
      relationships.  No sooner do you hear of Mary&#39;s gift than
      certain parts of your mind become concerned with why she was so
      generous and how this involved her affections and obligations.</p>

    <p>
      How can so many different thoughts proceed at the same time, without
      interfering with one another? I suspect that it is for the same
      reason that we have no trouble imagining an apple as both round and
      red at the same time: in that case, the processes for color and
      shape use agents that do not compete. Similarly, the different
      processes involved with ideas like <em>give</em> may operate in
      agencies so different that they rarely need to compete for the same
      resources.</p>
