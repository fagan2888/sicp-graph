<h2><em>20.3</em> visual ambiguity</h2>

    <p>
      We usually think of <em>ambiguity</em> as an aspect of language
      &mdash; but ambiguities are just as common in vision,
      too. What&#39;s that structure shown below? It could be regarded as
      nine separate blocks, as an arch supported by two other arches, or
      as a single, complicated, nine-block arch!</p>

    <p>
      What process makes us able to see that superarch as composed of
      three little arches rather than of nine separate blocks? How, for
      that matter, do we recognize those as blocks in the first place,
      instead of seeing only lines and corners? These <em>ambiguities</em>
      are normally resolved so quickly and quietly that our higher-level
      agencies have no sense of conflict at all. To be sure, we sometimes
      have the sense of perceiving the same structure in several ways at
      once &mdash; for example, as both a single complex arch and as three
      separate simpler arches.  But we usually lock in on one particular
      interpretation.</p>

    <p>
      Sometimes no lower-level information can resolve an ambiguity
      &mdash; as in the case of this example by Oliver Selfridge.</p>

    <p>
      Here, there is no difference whatever between the H and the A, yet
      we see them as having distinct identities in their different
      contexts.  Evidently, the <em>simulus</em> produced by the visual
      sense is strongly affected by the state of some language-related
      agency. Furthermore, just as we can describe the same figure in
      different ways, we often can describe different figures in the same
      way. Thus, we recognize all these figures as similar, though no two
      of them are actually the same:</p>

    <p>
      If we described each of these in terms of the lengths, directions,
      and locations of their lines, they would all seem very
      different. But we can make them all seem much the same by describing
      each of them in the same way, perhaps like this: <em>a triangle with
	two lines extended from one of its vertices.</em> The point is that
      what we <em>see</em> does not depend only on what reaches our eyes
      from the outside world. The manner in which we interpret those
      stimuli depends to a large extent on what is already taking place
      inside our agencies.</p>
