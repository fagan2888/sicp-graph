    <h2><em>26.10</em> learning language</h2>

    <p>
      The vocabulary of a language &mdash; the words themselves &mdash; is
      the product of a project that spans the history of a culture and can
      involve millions of person years of work. Every sense of every word
      records some intellectual discovery that now outlives the myriad
      other, less distinguished thoughts that never earned a name.</p>

    <p>
      Each person invents some new ideas, but most of these will die when
      their owners do, except for those that make their way into the
      culture&#39;s lexicon. Still, from that ever-growing reservoir we
      each inherit many thousands of powerful ideas that all our
      predecessors found. Yet it is no paradox to say that even as we
      inherit those ideas from our culture, we each must reinvent them for
      ourselves. We cannot learn meanings only by memorizing definitions:
      we must also
      <em>understand</em> them. Each situation in which a word is used
      must suggest some mixture of materials already in the mind of a
      listener, who then, alone, must attempt to assemble these
      ingredients into something that will work in consonance with other
      things already learned. Definitions sometimes help &mdash; but still
      one must separate the essences from the accidents of the context,
      link together structures and functions, and build connections to the
      other things one knows.</p>

    <p>
      A word can only serve to indicate that someone else may have a
      valuable idea &mdash; that is, some useful structure to be built
      inside the mind. Each new word only plants a seed: to make it grow,
      a listener&#39;s mind must find a way to build inside itself some
      structure that appears to work like the one in the mind from which
      it was <em>learned.</em></p>

    <p>
      Along with the words, we also have to learn the grammar-tactics for
      using them. Most children start by using only one or two words at a
      time. Then, over the next two or three years, they learn to speak in
      sentences. It usually takes a full decade to learn most of the
      conventions of adult speech, but we often see relatively sudden
      advances over concentrated periods of time. How do children learn
      such complicated skills so quickly? Some language theorists have
      suggested that children learn to use grammar so readily that our
      brains must be born with built-in grammar-machinery. However,
      we&#39;ve seen that our visual-systems solve many similar problems
      in even earlier years &mdash; and we&#39;ve also seen that when they
      learn to play with spoons and pails, children must learn yet other
      languagelike skills for managing the Origins, Destinations,
      Recipients, and Instruments of their actions. Thus, many sections of
      our brains appear to demonstrate capacities for rearranging pronome
      roles even before we learn to speak. If so, perhaps we ought not to
      wonder so much about how children learn to speak so
      readily. Instead, we ought to wonder why it takes so long, when they
      already do so many similar things inside their heads.</p>
