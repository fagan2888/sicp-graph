    <h2><em>10.8</em> education and development</h2>

    <p>
      Such lessons just don&#39;t seem to work very well. Given enough
      explanation and encouragement, and enough drill and practice, we can
      make children appear to understand &mdash; yet even then they
      don&#39;t often apply what they&#39;ve <em>learned</em> to real-life
      situations. Thus it seems that even when we lead them along these
      paths, they remain unable to use much of what we show to them until
      they develop inner signposts of their own.</p>

    <p>
      Here&#39;s my guess about what goes wrong. Presumably the child
      senses that the spaced-out eggs are <em>more</em> because they
      stretch across a longer span. Eventually, we want that sense of
      greater length to be canceled out by the sense that there&#39;s more
      empty space between the eggs. In the more mature Papert hierarchy,
      this would happen automatically &mdash; but for now, the child could
      learn this only as a special, isolated rule. Many other problems
      could also be solved by making special rules for them. But
      to <em>simulate</em> that multilayer society, complete with
      middle-level agents like Appearance and History, would involve so
      many special rules, and so many exceptions to them, that the younger
      child would be unable to manage so much complexity. The result is
      that educational programs allegedly designed <em>according to
	Piaget</em> often appear to succeed from one moment to the next, but
      the structures that result from this are so fragile and specialized
      that children can apply them only to contexts almost exactly like
      those in which they were learned.</p>

    <p>
      All this reminds me of a visit to my home from my friend Gilbert
      Voyat, who was then a student of Papert and Piaget and later became
      a distinguished child psychologist. On meeting our five-year-old
      twins, his eyes sparkled, and he quickly improvised some experiments
      in the kitchen. Gilbert engaged Julie first, planning to ask her
      about whether a potato would balance best on one, two, three, or
      four toothpicks.  First, in order to assess her general development,
      he began by performing the water jar experiment. The conversation
      went like this:</p>

    <p>
      Gilbert: <em>Is there more water in this jar or in that jar?</em>
      Julie: <em>It looks like there&#39;s more in that one. But you
	should ask my brother, Henry. He has conservation already.</em></p>

    <p>
      Gilbert paled and fled. I always wondered what Henry would have
      said. In any case, this anecdote illustrates how a young child may
      possess many of the ingredients of perception, knowledge, and
      ability needed for this kind of judgment &mdash; yet still not have
      suitably organized those components.</p>

    <p>
      Parent: Why are all the agents in your societies so competitive?
      They&#39;re always attacking each other. Instead of making Tall and
      Thin cancel each other out, why can&#39;t they cooperate?</p>

    <p>
      The first part of this book has given this impression because we had
      to begin with relatively simple mechanisms. It is fairly easy to
      resolve conflicts by switching among alternatives. It is much harder
      to develop mechanisms that can use cooperation and compromise
      &mdash; because that requires more complex ways for agencies to
      interact.  In later sections of this book we&#39;ll see how
      higher-level systems could make more reasonable negotiations and
      compromises.</p>
