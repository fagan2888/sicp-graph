    <h2><em>7.1</em> intelligence</h2>

    <p>
      Many people insist on having some definition of <em>intelligence.</em></p>

    <p>
      CRITIC: How can we be sure that things like plants and stones, or storms
      and streams, are not intelligent in ways that we have not yet conceived?</p>

    <p>
      It doesn&#39;t seem a good idea to use the same word for different
      things, unless one has in mind important ways in which they are the
      same.  Plants and streams don&#39;t seem very good at solving the kinds
      of problems we regard as needing intelligence.</p>

    <p>
      CRITIC: What&#39;s so special about solving problems? And why don&#39;t
      you define <em>intelligence</em> precisely, so that we can agree on what
      we&#39;re discussing?</p>

    <p>
      That isn&#39;t a good idea, either. An author&#39;s job is using words
      the ways other people do, not telling others how to use them. In the few
      places the word <em>intelligence</em> appears in this book, it merely
      means what people usually mean &mdash; the ability to solve hard
      problems.</p>

    <p>
      CRITIC: Then you should define what you mean by a <em>hard</em>
      problem. We know it took a lot of human intelligence to build the
      pyramids &mdash; yet little coral reef animals build impressive
      structures on even larger scales. So don&#39;t you have to consider them
      intelligent? Isn&#39;t it hard to build gigantic coral reefs?</p>

    <p>
      Yes, but it is only an illusion that animals can <em>solve</em> those
      problems!  No individual bird discovers a way to fly. Instead, each bird
      exploits a solution that evolved from countless reptile years of
      evolution.  Similarly, although a person might find it very hard to
      design an oriole&#39;s nest or a beaver&#39;s dam, no oriole or beaver
      ever figures out such things at all. Those animals
      don&#39;t <em>solve</em> such problems themselves; they only exploit
      procedures available within their complicated gene-built brains.</p>

    <p>
      CRITIC: Then wouldn&#39;t you be forced to say that evolution itself
      must be intelligent, since it solved those problems of flying and
      building reefs and nests?</p>

    <p>
      No, because people also use the word <em>intelligence</em> to emphasize
      swiftness and efficiency. Evolution&#39;s time rate is so slow that we
      don&#39;t see it as intelligent, even though it finally produces
      wonderful things we ourselves cannot yet make. Anyway, it isn&#39;t wise
      to treat an old, vague word like <em>intelligence</em> as though it must
      define any definite thing. Instead of trying to say what such a
      word <em>means,</em> it is better simply to try to explain how we use
      it.</p>

    <p>
      Our minds contain processes that enable us to solve problems we consider
      difficult. <em>Intelligence</em> is our name for whichever of those
      processes we don&#39;t yet understand.</p>

    <p>
      Some people dislike this <em>definition</em> because its meaning is
      doomed to keep changing as we learn more about psychology. But in my
      view that&#39;s exactly how it ought to be, because the very concept of
      intelligence is like a stage magician&#39;s trick. Like the concept
      of <em>the unexplored regions of Africa,</em> it disappears as soon as
      we discover it.</p>
