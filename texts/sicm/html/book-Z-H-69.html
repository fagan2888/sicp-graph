<p>Canonical transformations can be used to reformulate a problem in
coordinates that are easier to understand or that expose some symmetry
of a problem.</p>
<p>
In this chapter we have investigated different representations of a
dynamical system.  We have found that different representations will
be equivalent if the coordinate-momentum part of the transformation
has a symplectic derivative, and if the Hamiltonian transforms in a
specified way.  If the phase-space transformation is time independent,
then the Hamiltonian transforms by composition with the phase-space
transformation.  The symplectic condition can be equivalently
expressed in terms of the fundamental Poisson brackets.  The
Poisson bracket and the <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-23.gif" border="0"> function are invariant under
canonical transformations.  The invariance of <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-23.gif" border="0">
implies that the sum of the areas of the projections onto fundamental
coordinate-momentum planes is preserved (Poincar&eacute; integral
invariant) by canonical transformations.</p>
<p>
We can formulate an extended phase space in which time is treated as
another coordinate.  Time-dependent transformations are simple in the
extended phase space.  In the extended phase space the Poincar&eacute;
integral invariant is the Poincar&eacute;-Cartan integral invariant.  We
can also reformulate a time-independent problem as a time-dependent
problem with fewer degrees of freedom, with one of the original
coordinates taking on the role of time; this is the reduced phase
space.</p>
<p>
A generating function is a real-valued function of the phase-space
coordinates and time that represents a canonical transformation
through its partial derivatives.  We found that every canonical
transformation can be represented by a generating function.  The
proof depends on the Poincar&eacute; integral invariant (and not on the
fact that total time derivatives can be added to Lagrangians without
changing the equations of motion). </p>
<p>
The time evolution of any
Hamiltonian system induces a canonical transformation: if we consider
all possible initial states of a Hamiltonian system and follow all
of the trajectories for the same time interval, then the map from the
initial state to the final state of each trajectory is a canonical
transformation.  This is true for any interval we choose, so time
evolution generates a continuous family of canonical transformations.</p>
<p>
We generalized this idea to generate continuous canonical
transformations other than those generated by time evolution.  Such
transformations will be especially useful in support of perturbation
theory.</p>
<p>
In rare cases a canonical transformation can be made to
a representation in which the problem is easily solvable: when all
coordinates are cyclic and all the momenta are conserved.  Here we
investigated the Hamilton-Jacobi method for finding such canonical
transformations.  For problems for which the Hamilton-Jacobi method
works, we find that the time evolution of the system is given as a
canonical transformation.</p>
