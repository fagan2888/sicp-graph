[5.9  Lie Transforms](book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_5.9)
------------------------------------------------------

The evolution of a system under any Hamiltonian generates a continuous
family of canonical transformations. To study the behavior of some
system governed by a Hamiltonian *H*, it is sometimes appropriate to use
a canonical transformation generated by evolution governed by another
Hamiltonian-like function *W* on the same phase space. Such a canonical
transformation is called a *Lie transform*.

The functions *H* and *W* are both Hamiltonian-shaped functions defined
on the same phase space. Time evolution for an interval
![](chap1-Z-G-D-43.gif) governed by *H* is a canonical transformation
![](chap5-Z-G-D-11.gif)~![](chap1-Z-G-D-43.gif),\\ *H*~. Evolution by
*W* for an interval ![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif) is a canonical
transformation ![](chap5-Z-G-D-11.gif)'~![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif),\\ *W*~:

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-387.gif)

</div>

The independent variable in the *H* evolution is time, and the
independent variable in the *W* evolution is an arbitrary parameter of
the canonical transformation. We chose ![](chap5-Z-G-D-11.gif)' for the
*W* evolution so that the canonical transformation induced by *W* does
not change the time in the system governed by *H*.

Figure [5.9](book-Z-H-65.html#FIGURE_5.9) shows how a Lie transform is
used to transform a trajectory. We can see from the diagram that the
canonical transformations obey the relation

![](chap5-Z-G-388.gif)

</div>

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-389.gif)

</div>

For generators *W* that do not depend on the independent variable, the
resulting canonical transformation
![](chap5-Z-G-D-11.gif)'~![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif),\\ *W*~ is time
independent and symplectic. A time-independent symplectic transformation
is canonical if the Hamiltonian transforms by
composition:[^32^](#footnote_Temp_407)

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-390.gif)

</div>

We will use only Lie transforms that have generators that do not depend
on the independent variable.

#### [Lie transforms of functions](book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_408)

The value of a phase-space function *F* changes if its arguments change.
We define the function *E*'~![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif),\\ *W*~ of a
function *F* of phase-space coordinates (*t*, *q*, *p*) by

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-391.gif)

</div>

We say that *E*'~![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif),\\ *W*~ *F* is the Lie
transform of the function *F*.

In particular, the Lie transform advances the coordinate and momentum
selector functions *Q* = *I*~1~ and *P* = *I*~2~:

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-392.gif)

</div>

So we may restate equation ([5.422](#EQUATION_5.422)) as

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-393.gif)

</div>

More generally, Lie transforms descend into compositions:

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-394.gif)

</div>

In terms of *E*'~![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif),\\ *W*~ we have the canonical
transformation

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-395.gif)

</div>

We can also say

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-396.gif)

</div>

where *I* is the phase-space identity function: *I*(*t*, *q*, *p*) =
(*t*, *q*, *p*).

Note that *E*'~![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif),\\ *W*~ has the
property:[^33^](#footnote_Temp_409)

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-397.gif)

</div>

The identity *I* is

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-398.gif)

</div>

We can define the inverse function

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-399.gif)

with the property

#### [Simple Lie transforms](book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_410)

For example, suppose we are studying a system for which a rotation would
be a helpful transformation. To concoct such a transformation we note
that we intend a configuration coordinate to increase uniformly with a
given rate. In this case we want an angle to be incremented. The
Hamiltonian that consists solely of the momentum conjugate to that
configuration coordinate always does the job. So the angular momentum is
an appropriate generator for rotations.

The analysis is simple if we use polar coordinates *r*,
![](chap1-Z-G-D-19.gif) with conjugate momenta *p*~*r*~,
*p*~![](chap1-Z-G-D-19.gif)~. The generator *W* is just:

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-401.gif)

</div>

The family of transformations satisfies Hamilton's equations:

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-402.gif)

</div>

The only variable that appears in *W* is *p*~![](chap1-Z-G-D-19.gif)~,
so ![](chap1-Z-G-D-19.gif) is the only variable that varies as
![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif) is varied. In fact, the family of canonical
transformations is

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-403.gif)

</div>

So angular momentum is the generator of a canonical rotation.

The example is simple, but it illustrates one important feature of Lie
transformations -- they give one set of variables entirely in terms of
the other set of variables. This should be contrasted with the
mixed-variable generating function transformations, which always give a
mixture of old and new variables in terms of a mixture of new and old
variables, and thus require an inversion to get one set of variables in
terms of the other set of variables. This inverse can be written in
closed form only for special cases. In general, there is considerable
advantage in using a transformation rule that generates explicit
transformations from the start. The Lie transformations are always
explicit in the sense that they give one set of variables in terms of
the other, but for there to be explicit expressions the evolution
governed by the generator must be solvable.

Let's consider another example. This time consider a
three-degree-of-freedom problem in rectangular coordinates, and take the
generator of the transformation to be the *z* component of the angular
momentum:

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-404.gif)

</div>

The evolution equations are

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-405.gif)

</div>

We notice that *z* and *p*~*z*~ are unchanged, and that the equations
governing the evolution of *x* and *y* decouple from those of *p*~*x*~
and *p*~*y*~. Each of these pairs of equations represents simple
harmonic motion, as can be seen by writing them as second-order systems.
The solutions are

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-406.gif)

</div>

So we see that again a component of the angular momentum generates a
canonical rotation. There was nothing special about our choice of axes,
so we can deduce that the component of angular momentum about any axis
generates rotations about that axis.

#### [Example](book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_411)

Suppose we have a system governed by the Hamiltonian

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-407.gif)

</div>

Hamilton's equations couple the motion of *x* and *y*:

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-408.gif)

</div>

We can decouple the system by performing a coordinate rotation by
![](chap1-Z-G-D-15.gif)/4. This is generated by

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-409.gif)

</div>

which is similar to the generator for the coordinate rotation above but
without the *z* degree of freedom. Evolving (![](chap2-Z-G-D-22.gif);
*x*, *y*; *p*~*x*~, *p*~*y*~) by *W* for an interval of
![](chap1-Z-G-D-15.gif)/4 gives a canonical rotation:

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-410.gif)

</div>

Composing the Hamiltonian *H* with this time-independent transformation
gives the new Hamiltonian

<div align="left">

![](chap5-Z-G-411.gif)

</div>

which is a Hamiltonian for two uncoupled harmonic oscillators. So the
original coupled problem has been transformed by a Lie transform to a
new form for which the solution is easy.

<div class="footnote">

[^32^](#call_footnote_Temp_407) In general, the generator *W* could
depend on its independent variable. If so, it would be necessary to
specify a rule that gives the initial value of the independent variable
for the *W* evolution. This rule may or may not depend upon the time. If
the specification of the independent variable for the *W* evolution does
not depend on time, then the resulting canonical transformation
![](chap5-Z-G-D-11.gif)'~![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif),\\ *W*~ is time
independent and the Hamiltonians transform by composition. If the
generator *W* depends on its independent variable and the rule for
specifying its initial value depends on time, then the transformation
![](chap5-Z-G-D-11.gif)'~![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif),\\ *W*~ is time
dependent. In this case there may need to be an adjustment to the
relation between the Hamiltonians *H* and *H*'. In the extended phase
space all these complications disappear. There is only one case. We can
assume all generators *W* are independent of the independent variable.

[^33^](#call_footnote_Temp_409) The set of transformations
*E*'~![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif),\\ *W*~ with the operation composition and
with parameter ![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif) is a one-parameter Lie group.
