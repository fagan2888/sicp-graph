**Exercise 3.14.**  **Periodically driven pendulum**\
 Explore the dynamics of the driven pendulum, using the surface of
section method. We are interested in exploring the regions of parameter
space over which various phenomena occur. Consider a pendulum of length
9.8 m, mass 1 kg, and acceleration of gravity *g* = 9.8 m s^`-`2^,
giving ![](chap1-Z-G-D-23.gif)~0~ = 1 rad s^`-`1^. Explore the parameter
plane of the amplitude *A* and frequency ![](chap1-Z-G-D-23.gif) of the
periodic drive.

Examples of the phenomena to be investigated:

**a**.  Inverted equilibrium. Show the region of parameter space (*A*,
![](chap1-Z-G-D-23.gif)) in which the inverted equilibrium is stable. If
the inverted equilibrium is stable there is some range of stability,
i.e., there is a maximum angle of displacement from the equilibrium that
stable oscillations reach. If you have enough time, plot contours in the
parameter space for different amplitudes of the stable region.

**b**.  Period doubling of the normal equilibrium. For this case, plot
the angular momenta of the stable and unstable equilibria as functions
of the frequency for some given amplitude.

**c**.  Transition to large-scale chaos. Show the region of parameter
space (*A*, ![](chap1-Z-G-D-23.gif)) for which the chaotic zones around
the three principal resonance islands are linked.

**Exercise 3.15.**  **Spin-orbit surfaces of section**\
 Write a program to compute surfaces of section for the spin-orbit
problem, with the section points being recorded at pericenter.
Investigate the following:

**a**.  Give a Hamiltonian formulation of the spin-orbit problem
introduced in section [2.11.2](book-Z-H-31.html#%_sec_2.11.2).

**b**.  For out-of-roundness parameter ![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif) = 0.1 and
eccentricity *e* = 0.1, measure the widths of the regular islands
associated with the 1:1, 3:2, and 1:2 resonances.

**c**.  Explore the surfaces of section for a range of
![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif) for fixed *e* = 0.1. Estimate the critical value
of ![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif) above which the main chaotic zones around the
3:2 and the 1:1 resonance islands are merged.

**d**.  For a fixed eccentricity *e* = 0.1 trace the location on the
surface of section of the stable and unstable fixed points associated
with the 1:1 resonance as a function of the out-of-roundness
![](chap1-Z-G-D-12.gif).
