One way to simplify the analysis of a problem is to express it in a form
in which the solution has a simple representation. However, it may not
be easy to formulate the problem in such a way initially. It is often
useful to start by formulating the problem in one way, and then
transform it. For example, the formulation of the problem of the motion
of a number of gravitating bodies is simple in rectangular coordinates,
but it is easier to understand aspects of the motion in terms of orbital
elements, such as the semimajor axes, eccentricities, and inclinations
of the orbits. The semimajor axis and eccentricity of an orbit depend on
both the configuration and the velocity of the body. Such
transformations are more general than those that express changes in
configuration coordinates. Here we investigate transformations of
phase-space coordinates that involve both the generalized coordinates
and the generalized momenta.

Suppose we have two different Hamiltonian systems, and suppose the
trajectories of the two systems are in one-to-one correspondence. In
this case both Hamiltonian systems can be mathematical models of the
same physical system. Some questions about the physical system may be
easier to answer by reference to one model and others may be easier to
answer in the other model. For example, it may be easier to formulate
the physical system in one model and to discover a conserved quantity in
the other. Canonical transformations are maps between Hamiltonian
systems that preserve the dynamics.

A *canonical transformation* is a phase-space coordinate transformation
and an associated transformation of the Hamiltonian such that the
dynamics given by Hamilton's equations in the two representations
describe the same evolution of the system.
