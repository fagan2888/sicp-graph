| When we try to represent the figure formed by these two curves and their |
| intersections in a finite number, each of which corresponds to a doubly  |
| asymptotic solution, these intersections form a type of trellis, tissue, |
| or grid with infinitely serrated mesh. Neither of these two curves must  |
| ever cut across itself again, but it must bend back upon itself in a     |
| very complex manner in order to cut across all of the meshes in the grid |
| an infinite number of times. The complexity of this figure will be       |
| striking, and I shall not even try to draw it.                           |

We have seen rather complicated features appear as part of the Poincaré
sections of a variety of systems. We have seen fixed points, invariant
curves, resonance islands, and chaotic zones in systems as diverse as
the driven pendulum, the non-axisymmetric top, the Hénon-Heiles system,
and the spin-orbit coupling of a satellite. Indeed, even in the standard
map, where there is no continuous process sampled by the surface of
section, the phase space shows similar features.

The motion of other systems is simpler. For some systems conserved
quantities can be used to reduce the solution to the evaluation of
definite integrals. An example is the axisymmetric top. Two symmetries
imply the existence of two conserved momenta, and time independence of
the Hamiltonian implies energy conservation. With these conserved
quantities, determining the motion is reduced to the evaluation of
definite integrals of the periodic motion of the tilt angle as a
function of time. Such systems do not exhibit chaotic behavior; on a
surface of section the conserved quantities constrain the points to fall
on curves. We may conjecture that if points on a surface of section do
not apparently fall on curves then not enough conserved quantities exist
to reduce the solution to quadratures.

We have seen a number of instances in which the behavior of a system
changes qualitatively with the inclusion of additional effects. The free
rigid body can be reduced to quadratures, but the addition of
gravity-gradient torques in the spin-orbit system yields the familiar
mixture of regular and chaotic motions. The motion of an axisymmetric
top is also reducible to quadratures, but if the top is made
non-axisymmetric then the divided phase space appears. The system
studied by Hénon and Heiles, with the classic divided phase space, can
be thought of as a solvable pair of harmonic oscillators with nonlinear
coupling terms. The pendulum is solvable, but the driven pendulum has
the divided phase space.

We observe that, as additional effects are turned on, qualitative
changes occur in the phase space. Resonance islands appear, chaotic
zones appear, some invariant curves disappear, but others persist. Why
do resonance islands appear? How does chaotic behavior arise? When do
invariant curves persist? Can we draw any general conclusions?
