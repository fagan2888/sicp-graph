PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION

THE main change from the third edition is that the chapter 0n quantum
electrodynamics has been rewritten. The quantum electrodynamics
given in the third edition describes the motion of individual charged
particles moving through the electromagnetic ﬁeld, in close analogy
with classical electrodynamics. It is a form of theory in which the
number of charged particles is conserved and it cannot be generalized
to allow of variation of the number of charged particles.

In present-day high-energy physics the creation and annihilation
of charged particles is a frequent occurrence. A quantum electro-
dynamics which demands conservation of the number of charged
particles is therefore out of touch with physical reality. So I have
replaced it by a quantum electrodynamics which includes creation and
annihilation of electron-positron pairs. This involves abandoning any
close analogy with classical electron theory, but provides a closer
description ofnature. I t seems that the classical concept of an electron
is no longer a useful model in physics, except possibly for elementary

theories that are restricted to low-energy phenomena.

FROM THE
PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION

THE methods of progress in theoretical physics have undergone a
vast change during the present century. The classical tradition
has been to consider the world to be an association of observable
objects (particles, ﬂuids, ﬁelds, etc.) moving about according to
deﬁnite laws of force, so that one could form a mental picture‘ in
space and time of the whole scheme. This led to a physics whose aim
was to make assumptions about the mechanism and forces connecting
these observable objects, to account for their behaviour in the
simplest possible way. It has become increasingly evident in recent
times, however, that nature works on a different plan. Her funda-
mental laws do not govern the world as it appears in our mental
picture in any very direct way, but instead they control a substra-
tum of which we caénnot form a mental picture without intro-
ducing irrelevancies. The formulation of these laws requires the use
of the mathematics of transformations. The important things in
the world appear as the invariants (or more generally the nearly
invariants, or quantities with simple transformation properties)
of these transformations. The things we are immediately aware of
are the relations of these nearly invariants to a certain frame of
reference, usually one chosen so as to introduce special simplifying
features which are unimportant from the point. of view of general
theory.

The growth of the use of transformation theory, as applied ﬁrst to
relativity and later to the quantum theory, is the essence of the new
method in theoretical physics. Further progress lies in the direction
of making our equations invariant under wider and still Wider trans-
formations. This state of affairs is very satisfactory from a philo-
sophical point of view, as implying an increasing recognition of the
part played by the observer in himself introducing the regularities
that appear in his observations, and a lack of arbitrariness in the ways
of nature, but it makes things less easy for the learner of physics.
The new theories, if one looks apart from their mathematical setting,
are built up from physical concepts which cannot be explained in
terms of things previously known to the student, which cannot even
be explained adequately in words at all. Like the fundamental con-
cepts (eg. proximity, identity) which every one must learn on his

viii PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION

arrival into the world, the newer concepts of physics can be mastered
only by long familiarity with their properties and uses.

From the mathematical side the approach to the 116W theories
presents no difficulties, as the mathematics required (at any rate that
which is required for the development of physicsup to the present)
is not essentially different from what has been current for a consider-
able time. lliathematics is the tool specially suited for dealing with
abstract concepts of any kind and there is no limit to its power in this
ﬁeld. For this reason a book on the new physics, if not purely descrip-
tive of experimental work, must be essentially mathematical. All the
same the mathematics is only a tool and one should learn to hold the
physical ideas in one's mind without reference to the mathematical
form. In this book I have tried to keep the physics to the forefront,
by beginning with an entirely physical chapter arid in the later work
examining the physical meaning underlying the formalism wherever
possible. The amount of theoretical ground one has to cover before
being able to solve problems of real practical value is rather large, but
this circumstance is an inevitable consequence of the fundamental
part played by transibrlnation theory and is likely to become n10re
pronounced in the theoretical physics of the future.

With regard to the mathematical form in which the theory can be
presented, an author must decide at tlie outset between two methods.
There is the symbolic method, which deals directly in an abstract way
with the quantities of fundamental importance (the invariants, etc.,
of the transformations) and there is ‘the method of coordinates or
representations, which deals with sets of numbers corresponding to
these quantities. The second of these has usually been used for the
presentation of quantum mechanics (in fact it has been used practi-
cally exclusively with the exception of Weyl's book Gruppentheorie
und Quantenmechanelk). It is known under one or other of the two
names ‘Wave Mechanics’ and ‘Matrix Mechanics‘ according to which
physical things receive emphasis in the treatment, the states of a
system or its dynamical variables. It has the advantage that the kind
of mathematics required is more familiar to the average student, and
also it is the historical method.

The symbolic method, however, seems to go more deeply into the
nature of things. It enables one to express the physical laws in a neat
and concise way, and will probably be increasingly used in the future
as it becomes better understood and its own special mathematics gets

developed. For this reason I have chosen the symbolic method,
introducing the representatives later merely as an aid to practical
calculation. This has necessitated a complete break from the histori-
cal line of development, but this break is an advantage through
enabling the approach to the new ideas to-be made as direct as

possible.
