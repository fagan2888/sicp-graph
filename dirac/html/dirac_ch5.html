      <h1>V THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION</h1>
<h1>27. Schrodinger's form for the equations 0f motion</h1>
<p>OUR work from § 5 onwards has all been'concerned with one instant
of time. It gave the general scheme 0f relations between states and
dynamical variables for a dynamical system at one instant of time.
To get a complete theory of dynamics we must consider also the
connexion between different instants of time. When one makes an
observation on the dynamical system, the state of the system gets
changed in an unpredictable way, but in between observations
causality applies, in quantum mechanics as in classical mechanics,
and the system is governed by equations of motion which make the
state at one time determine the state at a later time. These equations
of n1otion we now proceed to study. They will apply so long as the
dynamical system is left undisturbed by any observation or similar
pTOOEBSSIl‘ Their general form can be deduced from the principle of
superposition of Chapter I.</p>
<p>Let us consider a particular state of motion throughout the time
during which the system is left undisturbed. We shall have the state
at any time t corresponding to a certain ket which depends on t and
which nlay be written It). If we deal with several of these states of
motion we distinguish them by giving them labels such as A, and we
then write the ket which corresponds to the state at time t for one
of them IAIZ). The requirement that the state at one time determines
the state at another time means that lAtn) determines |At&gt; except
for a numerical factor. The principle of superposition applies to these
states of motion throughout the time during which the system is
undisturbed, and means that if we take a superposition relation
holding for certain states at time to and giving rise to a linear equation
between the corresponding kets, e.g. the equation</p>
<p>|Rt0&gt; == cl[At0&gt;+c2]Bt0&gt;,
the same superposition relation must hold between the states of</p>
<p>motion throughout the ti1ne during which the system is undisturbed
and must lead to the same equation between the kets corresponding
T The preparation of a state is a process of this kind. It often takes the form of</p>
<p>making an observation and selecting the system when the result of the observation
turns out to be a certain pre-assigned number.</p>
<p>§27 SCHRODINGEB-‘S FORM FOR THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION 109</p>
<p>t0 these states at any time t (in tlie undisturbed time interval), i.e.
the equation 1m) = clIAt&gt;+C2|Bt&gt;’</p>
<p>provided tlie arbitrary numerical factors By “Yhich these kets may be</p>
<p>. multiplied are suitably chosen. It follows that the [Ptfs are linear</p>
<p>functions of the [Ptoys and each {Pt} is the result of some linear
operator applied to IP60). In symbols</p>
<p>IP¢&gt; = TIPQD, (1)
where T is a linear operator independent of P and depending only
on t (and to).</p>
<p>We now assume that each IP25) has the same length as the corre-
sponding {P50}. It is not necessarily possible to choose the arbitrary
numerical factors by which the |Pt)’s may be multiplied so as to
make this so without destroying the linear dependence of the |Pt&gt;’s
on the |Pt0&gt;’s. so the new assumption is a physical one and not just
a question of notation. It involves a kind of sharpening of the
principle of superposition. The arbitrariness in lPt) now becomes
merely a phase factor, which must be independent of P in order that
the linear dependence of the [PtYs on the |Pt0&gt;’s may be preserved.
From the condition that the length of c1|Pt&gt;+c2|Qt&gt; equals that of
c1[Pt0&gt;-[—c2[Qt0) for any complex numbers c1, c2, we can deduce that</p>
<p><QiiP¢> = (QIFOIPHD- (9)</p>
<p>The conncxion between the |Pt&gt;’s and |Pt0)’s is formally similar
to the connexion we had in§ 25 between the displaced and undisplaced
kets, with a process of time displacement instead of the space displace-
ment of § 25. Equations (l)and (2) play the part of equations (59)</p>
<p>and (60) of $25. We can develop the consequencesof these equations
as in § 25 and can deduce that T contains an arbitrary numerical</p>
<p>factor of modulus unity and satisfies
TT=L (3</p>
<p>correspondingto (62)of§ 25, so T is "aonitary. We pass to the infinitesi-
mal case by making t-&gt;- to and assume from physical continuity that</p>
<p>the limit
g-uo twto</p>
<p>exists. This limit is just the derivative of {Pia} with respect to to.</p>

<p>110 THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION g2?</p>
<p>The limit operator occurring here is, like (64)of§ 25, a pure imaginary
linear operator and is undetermined to the extent of an arbitrary
additive pure imaginary number. Putting this limit operator multi-
plied by i??? equal to H, or rather H (to) since it may depend on to,
equation (4) becomes, when written for a general t,</p>
<p>dlPt&gt; __
d1: _</p>
<p>Equation (5) gives the general law for the variation with time of
the ket corresponding to the state at any time. It is Sciaréidingeris-
form for the equations (f motion. It involves just one real linear
operator H(t), which must be characteristic of the dynamical system
under consideration. We assume that H (t) is the total energy (f
the system. There are two justifications for this assumption, (i) the
analogy with classical mechanics, which will be developed in the
next section, and (ii) we have HO?) appearing as He’, times an operator
of displacement in time similar to the operators of displacement in
the as, y, and z directions of § 25, so corresponding to (69) of § 25
we should have H05) equal to the total energy, since the theory of
relativity puts energy in the same relation to time as momentum to
distance.</p>
<p>We assume on physical grounds that the total energy of a system
is always an observable. For an isolated system it is a constant, and
may then be written H. Even when it is not a constant we shall often
write it simply H, leaving its dependence on t understood. If the
energy depends on t, it means the system is acted on by external
forces. An action of this kind is to be distinguished from a distur-
bance caused by a process of observation, as the former is compatible
with causality and equations of motion while the latter is not.</p>
<p>We can get a connexion between H (t) and the T of equation (l)
by substituting for IP25) in (5) its value given by equation (1). This
gives</p>

Equation (5) is very important for practical problems, where it is</p>
<p>usually used in conjunction with a representation. Introducing a</p>

<p>representation with a complete set of commuting observables 5
diagonal and putting &lt;§’]Pt) equal to M515), we have, passing to the
standard ket notation, IF)» = ma».</p>
<p>Equation (5) now becomes
iﬁgmet» = we». m</p>
<p>Equation (7) is known as Schrédingefs wave equation and its solutions
1,£¢(§t) are time-dependent wavefunctions. Each solution corresponds to</p>
<p>a state of motion of the system and the square of its modulus gives ‘</p>
<p>the probability of tlie Es having speciﬁed values at any time t. For
a system describable in terms of canonical coordinates and momenta
we may use Schrodinger's representation and can then take H to be
an operator of differentiation in accordance with (42) of § 22.</p>
<h1>28. Heisenberg's form for the equations 0f motion</h1>
<p>In the preceding section we set up a picture of the states of
undisturbed motion by making each of them correspond to a moving
ket, the state at any time corresponding to the ket at that time. We
shall call this the Schrédelnger picture. Let us apply to our kets the
unitary transformation which makes each ket la) go over into</p>
<p>la*) = T-1l@&gt;- (3)</p>
<p>This transformation is of the form given by (75) of § 26 with T "1 for
U, but it depends on the time t since T depends on t. It is thus to be
pictured as the application of a continuous motion (consisting of
rotations and uniform deformations) to the whole ket vector space.
A ket which is originally ﬁxed becomes a moving one, its motion being
given by (8) with |a&gt; independent of t. On the other hand, a ket
which is originally moving to correspond to a state of undisturbed
motion, i..e. in accordance with equation (l), becomes fixed, since on
substituting |Pt) for la) in (8) we get la*) independent of t. Thus
the transformation brings the kets corresponding to states cf undisturbed
motion to rest.</p>
<p>The unitary transformation must be applied also to bras and linear
operators, in order that equations between the various quantities may
remain invariant. The transformation applied to bras is given by the
conjugate imaginary of (8) and applied to linear operators it is given
by (70) of § 26 with T-l for U, i.e.</p>
<p>3* = TdocT. (9)</p>
<p>112 THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION §2s</p>
<p>A linear operator Which is originally ﬁxed transforms into a moving
linear operator in general. Now a dynamical variable corresponds to
a linear operator which is originally fixed (because it does not refer
to t at all), so after the transformation it corresponds to a moving
linear operator. The transformation thus leads us to a new picture
of the motion, in Which the states correspond to fixed vectors and
the dynamical variables to moving linear operators. We shall call
this the Heisenberg picture.</p>
<p>The physical condition of the dynarnical system at any time
inyolves the relation of the dynamical variables to the state, and
the change of the physical condition With time may be ascribed
either to a change in the state, With the dynamical variables kept
fixed, which gives us the Schrodinger picture, or to a change in the
dynamical variables, With the state kept ﬁxed, Which gives us the
Heisenberg picture.</p>
<p>In the Heisenberg picture there are equations of motion for the
dynamical variables. Take a dynamical variable corresponding to
the fixed linear operator v in the Schrodinger picture. In the Heisen-
berg picture it corresponds to a moving linear operator, Which We
Write as v, instead of v*, to bring out its dependence on t, and Which</p>
<p>is given by U: = T__12)T (19)
or Tv, = vT.</p>
<p>Differentiating With respect to t, We get

<p>§ 28 HEISENBERG'S FORM FOR THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION 113</p>
<p>Equation (11) 0r (13) shows hoW any dynamical variable varies
With time in the Heisenberg picture and gives us Heisenberg's form
for the equations of motion. These equations of motion are determined
by the one linear operator H], Which is just the transform of the linear
operator H occurring in Schr6dinger’s form for the equations of
motion and corresponds to the energy in the Heisenberg picture. We
shall call the dynamical variables in the Heisenberg picture, Where
they vary With the time, Heisenberg dynamical variables, to distinguish
them from the ﬁxed dynamical variables of the Schrodinger picture,
Which We shall call Schrodinger dynamical variables. Each Heisenberg
dynamical variable is connected With the corresponding Schrodinger
dynamical variable by equation (10). Since this connexion is a unitary
transformation, all algebraic and functional relationships are the
same for both kinds of dynamical variable. We have T = 1 for
t === to, so that w,“ = v and any Heisenberg dynamical variable at time
to equals the corresponding Schrodinger dynamical variable.</p>
<p>Equation (13) can be compared With classical mechanics, Where We
also have dynamical variables varying with the time. The equations
of motion of classical mechanics can be Written in the Hamiltonian</p>

<p>Where the g’s and 329s are a set of canonical coordinates and momenta
and H is the energy expressed as a function of them and possibly also
of t. The energy expressed in this Way is called the Hamiltmian.
Equations (14) give, for v any function of the q's and gfs that does
not contain the time t explicitly,</p>

<p>With the classical definition of a P.B., equation (1) of § 21. This is
of the same form as equation (13) in the quantum theory. We thus
get an analogy between the classical equations of motion in the
Hamiltonian form and the quantum equations of motion in Heisen-
berg's form. This analogy provides a justification for the assumption</p>
<p>114 THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION §28</p>
<p>that the linear operator H introduced in the preceding section is the
energy of the system in quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>In classical mechanics a dynamical system is deﬁned mathemati-
cally when the Hamiltonian is given, i.e. when the energy is given
in terms of a set of canonical coordinates and momenta, as this is
sufﬁcient to ﬁx the equations of motion. In quantum mechanics a</p>
<p>~ dynamical system is deﬁned mathematically when the energy is</p>
<p>given in terms of dynamical variables whose commutation relations
are known, as this is then sufﬁcient to ﬁx the equations of motion,
in both Schrodinger's and Heisenberg's form. We need to have
either H expressed in terms of the Schrodinger dynamical variables
or H} expressed in terms of the corresponding Heisenberg dynamical
variables, the functional relationship being, of course, the same in
both cases. We call the energy expressed in this way the Hamiltonian
of the dynamical system in quantum mechanics, to keep up the
analogy with the classical theory.</p>
<p>A system in'quantum mechanics always has a Hamiltonian, whether
the system is one that has a classical analogue and is describable in
terms of canonical coordinates and momenta or not. However, if the
system does have a classical analogue, its connexion with classical
mechanics is specially close and one can usually assume that the
Hamiltonian is the same function of the canonical coordinates and
momenta in the quantum theory as in the classical theoryf? There
would be a diiﬁculty in this, of course, if the classical Hamiltonian
involved a product of factors whose quantum analogues do not com-
mute, as one would not know in which order to put these factors in
the quantum Hamiltonian, but this does not happen for most of the
elementary dynamical systems whose study is important for atomic
physics. In consequence we are able also largely to use the same
language for describing dynamical systems in the quantum theory as
in the classical theory (e.g. to talk about particles xvith given masses
moving through given ﬁelds of force), and when given a system in
classical mechanics, can usually give a meaning to ‘the same’ system
in quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Equation (13) holds for v, any function of the Heisenberg dynamical
variables not involving the time explicitly, i.e. for v any constant</p>
<p>1' This assumption is found in practice to be successful only when applied with the
dynamical coordinates and momenta referring to a Cartesian system of axes and not
to more general curvilinear coordinates.</p>
<p>§28 HEISENBERG'S FORM FOR THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION 115</p>
<p>linear operator in the Schrodinger picture. It shows that such a
function w, is constant if it commutes with H, or if v commutes with H.
We then have v‘ = Uta = V’</p>
<p>and we call u, or u a constant 0f the motion. It is necessary that v shall
commute with H at all times, which is usually possible only if H is
constant. In this case we can substitute H for v in (13) and deduce
that H; is constant, showing that H itself is then a constant of the
motion. Thus if the Hamiltonian is constant in the Schrodinger
picture, it is also constant in the Heisenberg picture.</p>
<p>For an isolated system, a system not acted on by any external
forces, there are always certain constants of the motion. One of these
is the total energy or Hamiltonian. Others are provided by the
displacement theory of § 25. It is evident physically that the total
energy must remain unchanged if all the dynamical variables are
displaced in a certain way, so equation (63) of § 25 must hold with
ad = v s: H. Thus D commutes with H and is a constant of the
motion. Passing to the case of an infinitesimal displacement, we see
that the displacement operators dx, dy, and d, are constants of the
motion and hence, from (69) of § 25, the total Inomentum is a constant
of the motion. Again, the total energy must remain unchanged if all
the dynamical variables are subjected to a certain rotation. This
leads, as will be shown in § 35, to the result that the total angular
momentum is a constant of the motion. The laws of conservation of
energy, momentum, ana’ angular momentum hola’ for an isolated system
in the Heisenberg picture in quantum mechanics, as they hola’ in
classical mechanics.</p>
<p>Two forms for the equations of motion of quantum mechanics have
now been given. Of these, the Schrodinger form is the more useful
one for practical problems, as it provides the simpler equations. The
unknowns in Schrodinger's wave equation are the numbers which
form the representative of a ket vector, while Heisenberg's equation
of motion for a dynamical variable, if expressed in terms of a repre-
sentation, would involve as unknowns the numbers forming the
representative of the dynamical variable. The latter are far more
numerous and therefore more djﬁicult to evaluate than the Schro-
dinger unknowns. Heisenberg‘s form for the equations of motion is
of value in providing an immediate analogy with classical mechanics
and enabling one to see how various features of classical theory, such</p>
<p>116 THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION §28</p>
<p>as the conservation laws referred to above, are translated into quan-
tum theory.</p>
<h1>29. Stationary states</h1>
<p>We shall here deal with a dynamical system whose energy is con-
stant. Certain specially simple relations hold for this case., Equation
(6) can be integratedT to give
T x e-iHG-Jrﬂlﬁ</p>
<p>with the help of the initial condition that T = I for t = to. This
result substituted into (1) gives</p>
<p>|Pt&gt; = e-=¢H<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#114;&#45;&#61;&#64;">&#114;&#45;&#61;&#64;</a>/ﬁ11&gt;:.&gt;. &lt;16)</p>
<p>which is the integral of Schrodinger's equation of motion (5), and</p>
<p>substituted into (10)it gives
t z eiH(t-io)Iﬁve-iH(£-lo)]ﬁ (17)</p>
<p>which is the integral of Heisenberg's equation of motion (11), H} being
now equal to H. Thus we have solutions of the equations of motion
in a simple form. However, these solutions are not of much practical
value, because of the diﬁculty involved in evaluating the operator
e-‘H(‘*‘°Vﬁ, unless H is particularly simple, and for practical purposes
one usually has to -fall back on Schrodinger's wave equation.</p>
<p>Let us consider a state of motion such that at time to it is an eigen-
state of the energy. The ket jPto) corresponding to it at this time
must be an eigenket of H. If H’ is the eigenvalue to which it belongs,</p>
<p>13' 16 '
equa. 1011 ( ) gives [PD z (rdﬁxHoyhlptox</p>
<p>showing that {Pt} differs from IP25“) only by a phase factor. Thus
the state always remains an eigenstate of the energy, and further, it
does not vary with the time at all, since the direction of the ket |Pt)
does not vary with the time. Such a state is called a stationary state.
The probability for any particular result of an observation on it is
independent of the time when the observation is made. From our
assumption that the energy is an observable, there are sufficient
stationary states for an arbitrary state to be dependent on them.</p>
<p>The time-dependent wave function 5b(§t) representing a stationary
state of energy H’ will vary with time according to the law</p>
<p>5145i) = ¢&lt;&gt;(€)@—“H"'”, (18)</p>
<p>‘I’ The integration can be carried out as though H were an ordinary algebraic
variable instead of a linear operator, because there is no quantity that does not
commute with H in the work.</p>
<p>£29 STATIONARY STATES 117</p>
<p>and Schrodinger's Wave equation (7) for it reduces to
3160' = Helm) (19)</p>
<p>This equation merely asserts that the state represented by 1L0 is an
eigenstate-of H. We call a function tho satisfying (19) an eigenfunction
of H, belonging to the eigenvalue H’.</p>
<p>In the Heisenberg picture the stationary states correspond to ﬁxed
eigenvectors of the energy. We can set up a representation in which
all the basic vectors are eigenvectors of the energy and so correspond
to stationary statss in the Heisenberg picture. We call such a repre-
sentation a Heisenberg representation. The ﬁrst form of quantum
mechanics, discovered by Heisenberg in 1925, was in terms of a
representation of this kind. The energy is diagonal in the representa-
tion. Any other diagonal dynamical variable must commute with the
energy and is therefore a constant of the motion. The problem of
setting up a Heisenberg representation thus reduces to the problem
of ﬁnding a complete set of commuting observables, each of which
is a constant of the motion, and then making these observables
diagonal. The energy must be a function of these observables, from
Theorem 2 of § 19. It is sometimes convenient to take the energy
itself as one of them.</p>
<p>Let a denote the complete set of commuting observables in a
Heisenberg representation, so that the basic vectors are Written (of |,
1a”). The energy is a function of these observables a, say H = 3(a).
From (17) We get</p>

<p>Where H‘ = H (of) and H == H (of). The factor (a' Ivla") on the right-
hand side here is independent of t, being an element of the matrix
representing the ﬁxed Linear operator v. Formula (20) shows how the
Heisenberg matrix elements of any Heisenberg dynamical variable
vary with time, and it makes v, satisfy the equation of motion (11),
as is easily veriﬁed. The variation given by (20) is simply periodic</p>
<p>with the frequency
[ﬁF-Hﬂ/Zn-ii = |H’-H”[/h, (21)</p>
<p>depending only on the energy difference of the two stationary states
to which the matrix element refers. This result is closely connected</p>

magnetic radiation emitted or absorbed when the system makes a
transition under the inﬂuence of radiation between the stationary
states a’ and a", the eigenvalues of H being Bohfs energy levels.
These matters will be dealt with in § 45.</p>
<h1>30. The free particle</h1>
<p>The most fundamental and elementary application of quantum
mechanics is to the system consisting merely of a free particle, or
particle not acted on by any forces. For dealing with it we use as
dynamical variables the three Cartesian coordinates x, y, z and their
conjugate momenta p,,, p,, p,. The Hamiltonian is equal to the
kinetic energy of the particle, namely</p>
<p>H = §goi+pi+pe &lt;22)</p>
<p>according to Newtonian mechanics, m being the mass. This formula
is valid only if the velocity of the particle is small compared with c,
the velocity of light. For a rapidly moving particle, such as we often
have to deal with in atomic theory, (22) must be replaced by the
relativistic formula</p>
<p>H = @(m2&lt;&gt;<em>+21&gt;.%+2v§,+2@§)</em>- (23)</p>
<p>For small values of p,,, p,, and p, (23) goes over into (22), except for
the constant term mcZ which corresponds to the rest-energy of the
particle in the theory of relativity and which has no inﬂuence on the
equations of motion. Formulas (22) and (23) can be taken over
directly into the quantum theory, the square root in (23) being now
understood as the positive square root defined at the end of $1 1.
The constant term mc2 by which (23)differs from (22)for small values
of p,,, p,, and p, can still have no physical effects, since the Hamil-
tonian in the quantum theory, as introduced in § 27, is undefined to
the extent of an arbitrary additive real constant.</p>
<p>We shall here work with the more accurate formula (23). We shall
first solve the Heisenberg equations of motion. From the quantum
conditions (9) of § 2l, pg commutes with p, and p,,, and hence, from
Theorem l of § 19 extended to a set of commuting observables, p,,
commutes with any function of pa, p,, and p, and therefore with H.
It follows that p, is a constant of the motion. Similarly p, and p, are
constants of the motion. These results are the same as in the classical</p>
<p>§30 THE FREE PARTICLE 119</p>
<p>theory. Again, the equation of motion for a coordinate, x, say, is,
according to (11),</p>

state of the Hamiltonian, belonging to the eigenvalue

<p>The function (29) of as, y, z, and t describes plane Waves in space-
time. We see from this example the suitability of the terms ‘Wave
function‘ and ‘Wave equation‘. The frequency of the Waves is</p>

<p>120 THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION §30</p>
<p>their wavelength is</p>
<p>A = RKPLEJrPLLFPEF‘ = h/P’, (31)</p>
<p>P’ being the length of the vector (p;,p;,,p;), and their motion is in
the direction specified by the vector (pgmpéqag) with the velocity</p>
<p>A.» = H’/P' = C2/V', (32)</p>
<p>v' being the velocity of the particle corresponding to the momentum</p>
<p>(pg, 19;, 19;) as given by formula (26). Equations (30), (31), and (32)</p>
<p>are easily seen to hold in all Lorentz frames of reference, the expres-
sion on the right-hand side of (29) being, in fact, relativistically
invariant "with 19;, p2,, p; and H ’ as the components of a 4-vector.
These properties of relativistic invariance led de Broglie, before the
discovery of quantum mechanics, to postulate the existence of waves
of the form (29) associated with the motion of any particle. They
are therefore known as de Broglie waves.</p>
<p>In the limiting case when the mass m is made to tend to zero, the
classical velocity of the particle v becomes equal to c and hence, from
(32), the wave velocity also becomes c. The waves are then like the
light-waves associated with a photon, with the difference that they
contain no reference to the polarization and involve a complex ex-
ponential instead of sines and cosines. Formulas (30) and (31) are
still valid, connecting the frequency of the light-waves with the
energy of the photon and the wavelength of the light-waves with
the momentum of the photon.</p>
<p>For the state represented by (29), the probability of the particle
being found in any specified small volume when an observation of its
position is made is independent of where the volume is. This provides
an example of Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty, the state being
one for which the momentum is accurately given and for which, in
consequence, the position is completely unknown. Such a state is,
of course, a limiting case which never occurs in practice. The states
usually met with in practice are those represented by wave packets,
which may be formed by superposing a number of waves of the type
(29) belonging to slightly different values of (p5,, gﬂppg), as discussed
in § 24. The ordinary formula in hydrodynamics for the velocity of
such a wave packet, i.e. the group velocity of the waves, is</p>

<h1>31. The motion 0f Wave packets</h1>
<p>The result just deduced for a free particle is an example of a general
principle. For any dynamical system With a classical analogue, a state
for Which the classical description is valid as an approximation is
represented in quantum mechanics by a Wave packet, all the co-
ordinates and momenta having approximate numerical values, Whose
accuracy is limited by Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty. Now
Schrodinger's Wave equation ﬁxes hoW such a Wave packet varies With
time, so in order that the classical description may remain valid, the
Wave packet should remain a Wave packet and should move according
to the laWs of classical dynamics. We shall verify that this is so.</p>
<p>We take a dynamical system having a classical analogue and let
its Hamiltonian be H (q,., p,,) (r= 1, 2,..., n). The corresponding classi-
cal dynamical system will have as Hamiltonian Egg” p,,) say, obtained
by putting ordinary algebraic variables for the g, and p, in H (gr, p,,)
and making 5 --&gt;- 0 if it occurs in H(g,., p,.). The classical Hamiltonian
H, is, of course, a real function of its variables. It is usually a
quadratic function of the momenta p,, but not always so, the
relativistic theory of a free particle being an example Where it is not.
The followingargument is valid for H, any algebraic function of thep's.</p>

<p>Where A and S are real functions of the q's and t Which do not vary

<p>Let us now suppose that h can be counted as small and let us neglect;
terms involving ii in (3 7). This involves neglecting the pfs that occur
in H in (37), since each p, is equivalent to the operator @2171 EJ/Bg,

<p>To obtain an equation for A , we must retain the terms in (3 7)

the p's give a contribution to the P.B. which can be evaluated most
easily With the help of the classical formula (l) of § 21 (this formula

<p>For a given S, let us take a solution of (42) for which at some
deﬁnite time the density A2 vanishes everywhere outside a certain
small region. We may suppose this region to move with the ﬂuid,
its velocity at each point being given by (43), and then the equation
of conservation (42) will require the density always to vanish outside
the region. There is a limit to how small the region may be, imposed
by the approximation we made in neglecting 1'2’. in (39). This approxi-

<p>Our solution is then a wave packet of the type discussed in § 24 and
remains so for all time.</p>
<p>We thus get a wave function representing a state of motion for
which the coordinates and momenta have approximate numerical
values throughout all time. Such a state of motion in quantum
theory corresponds to the states with which classical theory deals.

<p>We see in this way how the classicalequations of motion are derivable
from the quantum theory as a limiting case.</p>
<p>.By a more accurate solution of the wave equation one can show
that the accuracy with which the coordinates and momenta simul-
taneously have numerical values cannot remain permanently as
favourable as the limit allowed by Heisenberg's principle of un-
certainty, equation (56) of § 24, but if it is initially so it will become
less favourable, the wave packet undergoing a spreadingtf</p>
<h1>32. The action principlei</h1>
<p>Equation (10) shows that the Heisenberg dynamical variables at
time t, v), are connected with their values at time to, 21,0, or v, by a
unitary transformation. The Heisenberg variables at time t+8t are
connected with their values at time t by an infinitesimal unitary
transformation, as is shown by the equation of motion (l l) or (13),
which gives the connexion between 0H5; and v, of the form of (79) or
(80) of § 26 with H; for F and Sci/ii for e. The variation with time of
the Heisenberg dynamical variables may thus be looked upon as the
continuous unfolding of a unitary transformation. In classical
mechanics the dynamical variables at time t-l-St are connected with
their values at time t by an infinitesimal contact transformation and
the whole motion may be looked upon as the continuous unfolding of a
contact transformation. We have here the mathematical foundation
of the analogy between the classical and quantum equations of
motion, and can develop it to bring out the quantum analogue of all
the main features of the classical theory of dynamics.</p>

that the new basic vectors are just the transforms in the Heisenberg
picture of the original basic vectors in the Schrodinger picture, and
hence they must be connected with the Heisenberg dynamical</p>

depends explicitly on t. (52) is a solution of Schrodinger's wave

account of there being no A in (52), which makes the S of (52) com-
plex, but the real part of this S equals the S of (35) and its pure

of the classical Lagrangian, we pass to the case of an inﬁnitesimal

<p>The principle of least action in classical mechanics says that the

<p>832 THE ACTION PRINCIPLE 129</p>
<p>g}, being Written for 9Q, for brevity. At first sight there does not seem
t0 be any close correspondence between (59) and (60). We must,
however, analyse the meaning of (59) rather more carefully. We must
regard each factor B as a function of the q's at the two ends of the
time interval to which it refers. This makes the right-hand side of
(5 9)a function, not only of q, and q“, but also of all the intermediate
q's. Equation‘ (5 9) is valid only when we substitute for the inter-
mediate q's in its right-hand side their values for the real trajectory,
small variations in which values leave S stationary and therefore also,
from (58), leave B(t,t0) stationary. It is the process of substituting
these values for the intermediate q's which corresponds to the inte-
grations over all values for the intermediate q”s in (6 0). The quantum
analogue of the action principle is thus absorbed in the composition
law (60) and the classical requirement that the values of the inter-
mediate q’s shall make S stationary corresponds to the condition
in quantum mechanics that all values of the intermediate g”s
are important in proportion to their contribution to the integral
in (6 0).</p>
<p>Let us see how (59) can be a limiting case of (60) for 5 small. We
must suppose the integrand in (6 0)to be of the form aim”, where F is
a function of g5,q1,q;,...,q.,'n,q§ which remains continuous as f2 tends
to zero, so that the integrand is a rapidly oscillating function when
ﬁ is small. The integral of such a rapidly oscillating function will be
extremely small, except for the contribution arising from a region in
the domain of integration where comparatively large variations in
the q}, produce only very small variations in F. Such a region must
be the neighbourhood of a point where F is stationary for small varia-
tions of the g}, Thus the integral in (6 0)is determined essentially by
the value of the integrand at a point where the integrand is stationary
for small variations of the intermediate q”s, and so ( 60) goes over
into (59).</p>
<p>Equations (54) and (56) express that the variables qgp} are con-
nected with the variables g”,p” by a contact transformation and are
one of the standard forms of writing the equations of a contact trans-
formation. There is an analogous form for writing the equations of a

<h1>33. The Gibbs ensemble</h1>
<p>In our work up to the present we have been assuming all along that
our dynamical system at each instant of time is in a definite state,
that is to say, its motion is specified as completely and accurately as
is possible without conﬂictingwith the generalprinciples of the theory</p>
<p>This means that</p>
<p>§33 THE GIBBS ENSEMBLE 131</p>
<p>In the classical theory this would mean, of course, that all the coordi-
nates and momenta. have speciﬁed values. Now we may be interested
in a motion which is speciﬁed to a lesser extent than this maximum
possible. The present section will be devoted to the methods to be</p>
<p>used in such a .case.
The procedure in classical mechanics is to introduce what is called</p>
<p>a Gibbs ensemble, the idea of which is as follows. We consider all the
dynamical coordinates and momenta as Cartesian coordinates in a
certain space, the phase space, whose number of dimensions is twice
the number of degrees of freedom of the system. Any state of the
system can then be represented by a point in this space. This point
will move according to the classical equations of motion (14). Sup-
pose, now, that we are not given that the system is in a deﬁnite state
at any tintte, but only that it is in one or other of a number of possible
states according to a deﬁnite probability law. We should then be
able to represent it by a ﬂuid in the phase space, the mass of ﬂuid in
any volume of the phase space being the total probability of the
system being in any state whose representative point lies in that
volume. Each particle of the ﬂuid will be moving according to the
equations of motion (14). If we introduce the density p of the ﬂuid
at any point, equal to the probability per unit volume of phase space
of the system being in the neighbourhood of the corresponding state,
we shall have the equation of conservation</p>

<p>= ——[p, (65)
This may be considered as the equation of motion for the ﬂuid, since
it determines the density p for all time if p is given initially as a
function of the q's and p's. It is, apart from the minus sign, of the
same form as the ordinary equation of motion (15) for a dynamical</p>
<p>variable.
The requirement that the total probability of the system being in</p>
<p>any state shall be unity gives us a normalizing condition for p

<p>the integration being over the whole of phase space and the single</p>

<p>differential dq or dp being written to denote the product of all the
dgfs or dgfs. If B denotes any function of the dynamical variables,
the average value of B will be</p>
<p>ff a» dqdp- (w)</p>
<p>It makes only a trivial alteration in the theory, but often facilitates
discussion, if we work with a density p differing from the above one
by a positive constant factor, k say, so that we have instead of (66)</p>
<p>jfpdqdimk-</p>
<p>With this density we can picture the ﬂuid as representing a. "number
k of similar dynamical systems, all following through their motions
independently in the same place, without any mutual disturbance or
interaction. The density at any point ‘would then be the probable or
average number of systems in the neighbourhood of any state per unit
volume of phase space, and expression (67) would give the average
total value of B for all the systems. Such a set of dynamical systems,
which is the ensemble introduced by Gibbs, is usually not realizable
in practice, except as a rough approximation, but it forms all the
same a useful theoretical abstraction.</p>
<p>We shall now see that there exists a corresponding density p
in quantum mechanics, having properties analogous to the above.
It was ﬁrst introduced by von Neumann. Its existence is rather
surprising in view of the fact that phase space has no meaning in
quantum mechanics, there being no possibility of assigning numerical
values simultaneously to the q's and p's.</p>
<p>We consider a dynamical system which is at a certain time in one
or other of a number of possible states according to some given
probability law. These states may be either a discrete set or a con-
tinuous range, or both together. We shall here take for definiteness
the case of a discrete set and suppose them labelled by a parameter m.
Let the normalized ket vectors corresponding to them be Im) and let
the probability of the system being in the mth state be Pm. We then
define the quantum density p by</p>
<p>P = 2 lm&gt;13n&lt;ml- (68)</p>
<p>m
Let p’ be any eigenvalue of p and 1p’) an eigenket belonging to this
eigenvalue. Then</p>
<p>g lm&gt;Pm<mlP'> = P|P'&gt; = P’IP’&gt;</p>

S0 that Z <P’lm>Pm<mlP'> == p’<p'lp’.l>
In
01‘ Z Pml<mlp’>lg = P'<P'|P'>-
m</p>
<p>Now PW, being a probability, can never he negative. It follows that
p’ cannot be negative. Thus p has no negative eigenvalues, in analogy
With the fact that the classical density p is never negative.</p>
<p>Let us now obtain the equation of motion for our quantum p. In
Schrodinger-k picture the kets and bras in (68)Will vary With the time
in accordance With Schr6dinger’s equation (5) and the conjugate
imaginary of this equation, While the Pm’s Will remain constant, since
the system, so long as it is left undisturbed, cannot change over from
a state corresponding to one ket satisfying Schrodinger's equation to
a state corresponding to another. We thus have</p>

<p>This is the quantum analogue of the classical equation of motion
(65). Our quantum p, like the classical one, is determined for all time
if it is given initially.</p>
<p>From the assumption of § 12, the average value of any observable
[3 When the system is in the state m is (vnlmm). Hence if the system
is distributed over the various states m according to the probability
laW Pm, the average value of B Will be  Pmcmiﬁlm). If We introduce</p>

<p>the last step being easily Kferiﬁeal with the law of matrix multiplica~
tion, equation (44) of § 17. The expressions ('7 0) are the analogue of
the expression (67) of the classical theory. Whereas in tlie classical
theory We have to multiply B by p arid take the integral of the
product over all phase space, in the quzmntum theory we have to</p>
<p>multiply ,8 by p, With the factors in either order, and take the

<p>134 THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION §33</p>
<p>diagonal sum of the product in a representation. If the representa-
tion involves a continuous range of basic vectors E’), we get instead</p>
<p>°f (70) f &lt;é’IBPI€’&gt; as - f swpﬁsv dsx m)</p>
<p>so that we must carry through a process of ‘integrating along the
diagonal‘ instead of summing the diagonal elements. Weshall deﬁne
(7l)to be the diagonal sum of 5p in the continuous case. It can easily
be veriﬁed, from the properties of transformation functions (56) of
§ l8, that the diagonal sum is the same for all representations.</p>
<p>From the condition that the |m&gt;’s are normalized we get, with
discrete "s</p>
<p>since the total probability of the system being in any state is unity.
This is the analogue of equation (66). The probability of the system
being in the state E’, or the probability of the observables g which
are diagonal in the representation having the values 5’, is, according
to the rule for interpreting representatives of kets (51) of § l8,</p>
<p>Z l&lt;€|m&gt;|2Pm = &lt;€’IPI§'&gt;, (73)</p>
<p>7??-</p>
<p>which gives us a meaning for each term in t-he sum on the left-hand
side of (72). For continuous §”s, the right-hand side of (73) gives the
probability of the Es having values in the neighbourhood of 5’ per
unit range of variation of the values 5’.</p>
<p>As in the classical theory, we may take a density equal to k times
the above p and consider it as representing a Gibbs ensemble of k
similar dynamical systems, between which there is no mutual dis-
turbance or interaction. We shall then have k on the right-hand side
of (72), and (70) or (71) will give the total average B for all the
members of the ensemble, while (73) will give the total probability
of a member of the ensemble having values for its Ks equal to 2f’
or in the neighbourhood of 5' per unit range of variation of the
values 5'.</p>
<p>An important application of the Gibbs ensemble is to a dynamical
system in thermodynamic equilibrium with its surroundings at a
given temperature T. Gibbs showed that such a system is repre-
sented in classical mechanics by the density</p>
<p>§33 THE GIBBS ENSEMBLE 135</p>
<p>H being the Hamiltonisn, which is now independent of the time, k
being Boltzmanrfs constant, and c being a number chosen to make
the normalizing condition (66)hold. This formula may be taken over
unchanged into the quantum theory. At high temperatures, (74)
becomes p = c, which gives, on being substituted into the right-hand
side of (73), c<f'[§'> = c in the case of discrete E”s. This shows that
at high temperatures all discrete states are equally probable.</p>
