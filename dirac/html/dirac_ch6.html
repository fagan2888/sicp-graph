<h1>34. The harmonic oscillator</h1>
<p>A SIMPLE and interesting example of a dynamical system in quantum
mechanics is the harmonic oscillator. This example is of importance
for general theory, because it forms a corner-stone in the theory of
radiation. The dynamical variables needed for describing the system
are just one coordinate q and its conjugate momentum p. The
Hamiltonian in classical mechanics is</p>
<p>H = 1%,; @2+1112111212&gt;. &lt;1)</p>
<p>Where m is the mass of the oscillating particle and w is 2w times the
frequency. We assume the same Hamiltonian in quantum mechanics.
This Hamiltonian, together with the quantum condition (10) of § 22,
deﬁne the system completely.</p>
<p>The Heisenberg equations of motion are</p>
<p>Q1 = [911 H] = Pz/m» } (2)
fpt = [Pug] = _mw2qr
It is convenient to introduce the dimensionless complex dynamical
variable v7 = (QmEwFJ-‘(p-l-imwg). (3)
The equations of motion (2) give
1}; = (2m%w)“<em>i(-—mw2qt+iwpt) = i001)‘.
This equation can be integrated to give
</em>7: = "70 61m» (4)
Where v70 is a linear operator independent of t, and is equal to the
value of 1;, at time t m 0. The above equations are all as in the
classical theory.
We can express q and p in terms of v7 and its conjugate complex if
and may thus Work entirely in terms of v7 and '5. We have
ﬁwnﬁ = (2m)"l(p+imwq)tp—imwq)
= ( 2 m)‘ ‘h2+m”w2q2+imw( 6111-99)}
= Hmyzw (5)
and similarly 111111-111 = 114-51111. (B)
Thus 1711-1111" = 1. ('7)</p>
<p>§34 THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR 137</p>
<p>Equation (5) or (6) gives H in terms of 17 and 5;‘ and (7) gives the
commutation relation connecting 17 and i. From (5)</p>
<p>ﬁwﬁﬂﬁ = ﬁﬂ-aﬁwﬁ</p>
<p>and from (6) ﬁm-Mﬁ = fjﬁ+giiwg7ﬂ
Thus 53-11;,- = ﬁwﬁ. (8)
Also, (7)leads to ﬁqn-qnﬁ = nn""1 (9)</p>
<p>for any positive integer n, as may be veriﬁed by induction, since, by
multiplying (9) by 17 on the left, we can deduce ( 9) with n+1 for n.</p>
<p>Let H’ be an eigenvalue of H and |H’&gt; an eigenket belonging to it.
From (5)</p>
<p>%w<H’lnﬁ|H’> :- <H'IH—%?Y3¢=>IH'&gt; = (H’-%7Iw)<H'IH'>-</p>
<p>Now (H'|q-?j|H’&gt; is the square of the length of the ket ﬁiﬂ’), and</p>
<p>hence <H,I7YT.HH,> 2 0,
the case of equality occurring only if ﬁ[H’&gt; = 0. Also (H 1H’) &gt; 0.
Thus H’ ,2 155w, (10)</p>
<p>the case of equality occurring only if 1} [H ’&gt; = 0. From the form ( I )
of H as a sum of squares, we should expect its eigenvalues to be all
positive or zero (since the average value of H for any state mush be
positive or zero). We now have the more stringent condition (10)-
From (8)</p>
<p>Ham» = wﬁkﬁwanﬂv = <H'-%w)ﬁ|H'>_ &lt;11)
Now if H’ # %iiw, ﬁlli’) is not zero and is then according to (I l) an
eigenket of H belonging to the eigenvalue H’--%w. Thus, with H’
any eigenvalue of H not equal to 25am, H Q-ﬁw is another eigenvalue
of H. We can repeat the argument and infer that, if H Z-ﬁw gé éﬁw,
fIV-Zﬁw is another eigenvalue of H. Continuing in this way, we
obtain the series of eigenvalues H ’, H’—?iw, H ’-—2?iw, H ’— 3?iw,...,</p>
<p>which cannot extend to inﬁnitys,~,_beca.use then it would contain eigen-
values contradicting (10), and can terminate only with the value éiiw.</p>
<p>Again, from the conjugate complex of equation (8)
H17|H'&gt; = (qH-}—%w17)[H'&gt;= (IT-l-ﬁwyrﬂff’),
showing that H ﬂl-ﬁw is another eigenvalue of H , pvith »q|H’&gt; as an</p>
<p>eigenket belonging to it, unless qlﬂ’) = O. The latter alternative
can be ruled out, since it would lead to</p>
<p>0 = ﬁwﬁﬂlff&gt; = (H+%5w)lH’&gt; = (H’+%?iw)|H’&gt;,</p>
<p>13s ELEMENTARY APPLICATIONS §34</p>
<p>which contradicts (l0). Thus IT-f-iliw is always another eigenvalue
of H, and so are H "+ 21w, H ‘+33%; and so on. Hence the eigenvalues
of H are the series of numbers</p>
<p>1,11%, 3am,  gram,  (12)</p>
<p>extending to inﬁnity. These are the possible energy values for the
harmonic oscillator.</p>
<p>Let |O&gt; be an eigenket of H belonging to the lowest eigenvalue
$100, SO   i 0, </p>
<p>and form the sequence of kets</p>
<p>l9)» ﬂ|0&gt;, 72210), ﬂslo)»  (14)</p>
<p>These kets are all eigenlsets of H, belonging to the sequence of eigen-
values (l2) respectively. From (9) and (l3)</p>
<p>ﬁwnlfl) = m2”“|0&gt; (15)
for any non-negative integer n. Thus the set of kets (14) is such that
1; or 1'7" applied to any one of the set gives a ket dependent on the set.
Now all the dynamical variables in our problem are expressiblein terms
of w) and '5, so the kets (l4)must form a complete set (otherwisethere
would be some more dynamical variables). There is just one of these
kets for each eigenvalue (12) of H , so H by itself forms a complete
commuting set of observables. The kets (14) correspondto the various
stationary states of the oscillator. The stationary state with energy</p>
<p>(n-lﬁﬂiw, corresponding to 1W0), is called the nth quantum state.
The square of the length of the ket 'q'"’[0&gt; is</p>
<p>&lt;0|1rv~|&lt;&gt;&gt; = "49I17“"1v”"1l0&gt;
with the help of (l5). By induction, we ﬁnd that</p>
<p>&lt;0Iﬁ”v"'|0&gt; = n! &lt;16)
provided l0) is normalized. Thus the kets (l4) multiplied by the
coefficients n?!’ with n = 0,1, 2,..., respectively form the basic kets
of a representation, namely the representation with H diagonal. Any
ket Ix) can be expanded in the form</p>
<p>1x&gt; = vat», ' (11)</p>
<p>where the sags are numbers. In this way the ket Ix) is put into
correspondence with a power series 2:0,, 1;" in the variable w], the
various terms in the power series corresponding to the various
stationary states. If 1x) is normalized, it deﬁnes a state for which</p>

i.e. the probability of H having the value (n-l-éﬁiw, is</p>
<p>P” = n/Lrnlg, (18)
as follows from the same argument Which led to (5 l)of $18.</p>
<p>We may consider the ket |0) as a standard ket and the power series
in 1] as a Wave function, since any ket can be expressed as such a
Wave function multiplied into this standard ket. We get a kind of
Wave function differing from the usual kind, introduced by equations
(62) of § 20, in that it is a function of the complex dynamical variable
1) instead of observables. It Was first introduced by V. Fock, so We
shall call the representation F0ck’s representation. It is for many
purposes the most convenient representation for describing states of
the harmonic oscillator. The standard ket |0&gt; satisfies the condition
(13), which replaces the conditions (43) of $22 for the standard ket
in Schrodingefs representation.</p>
<p>Let us introduce Schrodingefs representation With q diagonal and
obtain the representatives of the stationary states. From (l3)and (3)</p>
<p>(Peimwqﬂw = 0,</p>
<p>so <q’|p--elmwgl0> = O.
With the help of (45) of § 22, this gives

The solution of this differential equation is

We have here the representative of the normal state, as the state of

states can be obtained from it. We have from (3)</p>

This may easily be Worked out for small values 0f"n. The result is of

tive of the nth quantum state. The phase factor i" may be discarded.</p>

<li>Angular momentum</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us consider a particle described by the three Cartesian coordi-
nates X, y, z and their conjugate momenta p,, p,, p,. Its angular
momentum about the origin is deﬁned as in the classical theory, by</p>
<p>ma, = 21212-2211, my = 2295-229. mg = wry-m.’ (22)</p>
<p>or by the vector equation
m = xxp.
We must evaluate the P.B.s of the angular momentum components
with the dynamical variables X, 1a,, etc., and with each other. This
We cam do most conveniently with the help of the laws (4) and (5) 0f
§ 21, thus

[mpmm] = my, [mapmg] = ma.</p>
<p>These results are all the same as in the classical theory. The sign in
the results (23), (25), and (27) may easily be remembered from the
rule that the + sign occurs when the three dynamical variables, con-
sisting of the two in the P.B. on the left-hand sideand the one
forming the result on the right, are in the cyclic order (Xyz) and the
— sign occurs otherwise. Equations (27) may be put in the vector</p>
<p>“In m &gt;&lt; m. = 132m. (28)</p>
<p>Now suppose We have several particles with angular momenta
m1,m2,.... Each of these angular momentum vectors Will satisfy
(28), thus</p>
<p>m, x m, = 21713111,,
and any one of them will commute With any other, so that</p>
<p>m,.&gt;<ms+ms>&lt;m, = 0 (r ;é s).</p>

<p>= m; 2 m, = 01M. (29)</p>
<p>This result is of the same form as (28), so that the components of the
total angular momentum M of any number of particles satisfy the
same commutation relations as those of the angular momentum of
a single particle.</p>
<p>Let A,, A,, A, denote the three coordinates of any one of the
particles, or else the three components of momentum of one of
the particles. The A's will commute with the angular momenta of
the other particles, and hence from (23), (24), (25), and (26)</p>
<p>[llfmAm] = A,,, [lkfwAy] =—= -A,,, [M,,,A,] = 0. (30)</p>
<p>If Bx, By, B, are a second set of three quantities denoting the
coordinates or momentum components of one of the particles, they
will satisfy similar relations to (30). We shall then have</p>

<p>and similarly [l\/I, Cy] = —C',,,, [ZVQCZ] = O.</p>
<p>These equations are again of the form (30), with C for A. We can
conclude from this Work that equations of the form (30) hold for the
three components of any vector that We can construct from our
dynamical variables, and that any scalar commutes With M.</p>
<p>We can introduce linear operators R referring to rotations about
the origin in the same Way in which We introduced the linear operators
D in § 25 referring to displacements. Taking a rotation through an</p>
<p>142 ELEMENTARY APPLICATIONS § 35</p>
<p>angle Sql about the z-axis and making 3gb inﬁnitesimal, we can obtain
the limit operator corresponding to (64) of § 25,
' _ I
gig‘) (R lli5¢&gt;</p>
<p>which we shall call the rotation opera-tor about the z-axis and denote
by r5. Like the displacement operators, r, is a pure imaginary linear
operator and is undetermined to the extent of an arbitrary additive
pure imaginary number. Corresponding to (66) of § 25, the change
in any dynamical variable v caused by a rotation through a small
angle 895 about the z-axis is</p>
<p>Sglﬂrzvmvig), (31)
to the ﬁrst order in 89S. Now the changes produced in the three
components A,, A,, A, of a vector by a (right-handed) rotation 396
about the z-axis applied to all measuring apparatus are M514”,</p>
<p>~—8qSA_,,, and 0 respectively, and any scalar quantity is unchanged by
the rotation. Equating these changes to (31), are ﬁnd that</p>
<p>rzAm-Axrz = Ag, rzatly~Alurz 1: "Ax,
rzAz-Azrz = O,</p>
<p>and r, commutes with any scalar. Comparing these results with (30),
we see that ilirz satisﬁes the same commutation relations as M3.
Their difference, lI@--i?ir,,, commutes xvit-h all the dynamical variables
and must therefore be a number. This number, which is necessarily
real since M, and 21hr, are real, may be made zero by a suitable choice
of the arbitrary pure imaginary number that can be added to w‘, We
then have the result M = i%?<em>z</em> (32)</p>
<p>Z
Similar equations hold for llfx and lily. They are the analogues of (69)
of $25. Thus the total angular momentum is connected with the rota-
tion operators as the total momentum is connected with the displacement
operators. This conclusion is valid for any point as origin.</p>
<p>The above argument applies to the angular momentum arising
from the motion of particles, defined by (22) for each particle. There
is another kind of angular momentum occurring in atomic theory,
spin an guhr momentum. The former kind of angular momentum will
be called orbital angular momentum, to distinguish it. The spin angu-
lar momentum of a particle should be pictured as due to some internal
motion of the particle, so that it is associated with different degrees
of freedom from those describing the motion of the particle as a whole,</p>
<p>§35 ANGULAR MOMENTUM 143</p>
<p>and hence the dynamical variables that describe the spin must com-
mute with x, y, z, p,, p,, and p,. The spin does not correspond very
closely to anything in classical mechanics, so the method of classical
analogy is not suitable for studying it. However, we can build up a
theoryof the spin simply from the assumption that the components
of the spin angular nlomentum are connected with the rotation opera-
tors in the same way as we had above for orbital angular momentum,
i.e. equation (32) holds with M, as the z component of the spin angular
momentum of a particle and w, as the rotation operator about the
z-axis referring to states of spin of that particle. With this assump-
tion, the commutation relations connecting the components of the
spin angular momentum M with any vector A referring to the spin
must be of the standard form (30), and hence, taking A to be the
spin angular momentum itself, we have equation (29) holding also
for the spin. We now have (29) holding quite generally, for any sum
of spin and orbital angular momenta, and also (30) will hold generally,
for M the total spin and orbital angular momentum and A any vector
dynamical variable, and the connexion between angular momentum
and rotation operators will be always valid.</p>
<p>As an immediate consequence of this connexion, we can deduce the
lav cf conservation cf angular momentum. For an isolated system, the
Hamiltonian must be unchanged by any rotation about the origin, in
other words it must be a scalar, so it must commute with the angular
momentum about the origin. Thus the angular momentum is a
constant of the motion. For this argument the origin may be any
point.</p>
<p>As a second immediate consequence, we can deduce that a state
with zero total angular momentum is spherically symmetrical. The state
will correspond to a ket IS), say, satisfying</p>
<p>Mwl3&gt; = BIyiS&gt; = %|3&gt; 2 l
and hence rx|S&gt; = QIIS) = QIS) = 0.</p>
<p>This shows that the ket IS) is unaltered by inﬁrlitesimal rotations,
and it must therefore be unaltered by finite rotations, since the latter
can be built up from infinitesimal ones. Thus the state is spherically
symmetrical. The converse theorem, a spherically symmetrical state
has Zero total angular momentum, is also true, though its proof is not
quite so simple. A spherically symmetrical state corresponds to a ket
{S} whose direction is unaltered by any rotation. Thus the change</p>
<p>144 ELEMENTARY APPLICATIONS § 35</p>
<p>in IS) produced by a rotation operator rm, 91y, or r, must be a numerical
multiple of IS), say
Tm|S&gt; = 6x115’), Tyls) = 6,13% Tz|S&gt; = 651$,
Where the c's are numbers. This gives
Mx|S&gt; = iﬁ¢xl5&gt;, MAS) m iﬁvylsh .</p>
<p>1mm = was; (33)
These equations are not consistent With the commutation relations
(29) for M, My, M, unless 0,, = 0,, = o, = 0, in Which case the state
has zero total angular momentum. We have in (33) an example of
a ket Which is simultaneously an eigenket of the three non-commuting</p>
<p>linear operators Mm, My, 1%, and this is possible only if all three
eigenvalues are zero.</p>
<ol>
<li>Properties of angular momentum</li>
</ol>
<p>There are some general properties of angular momentum, deducible
simply from the commutation relations between the three compo-
nents. These properties must hold equally for spin and orbital angular
momentum. Let m, my, m, be the three components of an angular
momentum, and introduce the quantity B deﬁned by</p>
<p>.8 = mz+ms+ma
Since B is a scalar it must commute With m,, my, and m,. Let us
suppose We have a dynamical system for which mm, my, m, are the
only dynamical variables. Then B commutes With everything and</p>
<p>must be a number. We can study this dynamical system on much
the same lines as We used for the harmonic oscillator in § 34.</p>
<p>Put mm-zmy = ":7.

of eigenvalues mg, mQ-ii, w2,_;--2?i,..., which must terminate from (41),

<p>can terminate only with the value k. We can conclude that 2k is an
integral multiple of ﬁ, and that the eigenvalues of a115, are</p>
<p>k, k-ﬁ, k-zh,  ~k+%, -1&lt;. (42)</p>
<p>146 ELEMENTARY APPLICATIONS §35</p>

eigenvalues are all integral or half odd integral multiples of f1, accord-

<p>These kets are all eigenkets of m, belonging to the sequence of eigen-
values (42)respectively. The set of kets (44)is such that the operator
17 applied to any one of them gives a ket dependent on the set (n
applied to the last gives zero), and from (36) and (43) one sees
that ﬁ applied to any one of the set also gives a ket dependent on the
set. All the dynamical variables for the system we are now dealing
with are expressible in terms of 17 and ﬁ, so the set of kets (44) is a
complete set. There is just one of these kets for each eigenvalue (42)
of m, so m, by itself forms a complete commuting set of observables.</p>
<p>It is convenient to deﬁne the magnitude of the angular momentum
vector In to be k, given by (39), rather than 8*, because the possible</p>
<p>values for k are O, g2’ ﬁ, 3%, 2%’ m’ (4:5)</p>

complicated set of numbers.</p>
<p>For a dynamical system involving other dynamical variables besides
m, my, and m,, there may be variables that do not commute with 
Then ,8 is no longer a number, but a general linear operator. This
happens for any orbital angular momentum (22), as x, y, z, p,, p,,, and</p>
<p>p, do not commute xvith ,8. We shall assume that B is always an
observable, and k can then be deﬁned by (39) with the positive square
root function and is also an observable. We shall call k so defined
the magnitude of the angular momentum vector In in the general
case. The above analysis by which we obtained the eigenvalues of
m, is still valid if we replace {mg} by a simultaneous eigenket 115mg)
of the commuting observables 1c and m,, and leads to the result that
the possible eigenvalues for k are the numbers (45), and for each
eigenvalue 1c’ of k the eigenvalues of m, are the numbers (42)with k‘
substituted for k. We have here an example of a phenomenon which
we have not met with previously, namely that With two commuting
observables, the eigenvalues of one depend on what eigenvalue we</p>
<p>§36 PROPERTIES OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM 147</p>
<p>assign t0 the other. This phenomenon may be understood as the two
observables being not altogether independent, but partially functions
of one another. The number of independent simultaneous eigenkets
of k and m, belonging to the eigenvalues k’ and m; must be indepen-
dent of mg, since for each independent ]?c’m;&gt; we can obtain an
independent |l&lt;:'m;&gt;, for any m; in the sequence (42), by multiplying
|l::’m_§,&gt; by a suitable power of v7 or 5i.</p>
<p>As an example let us consider a dynamical system with two angular
momenta m, and m2, which commute with one another. If there are
no other dynamical variables, then all the dynamical variables com-
mute with the magnitudes k1 and k2 of m, and m2, so k1 and k2 are
numbers. However, the magnitude K of the resultant angular
momentum M = ml-l-m, is not a number (it does not commute
with the components of m, and m2) and it is interesting to work out
the eigenvalues of K. This can be done most simply by a method
of counting independent kets. There is one independent simultaneous
eigenket of m, and ma, belonging to any eigenvalue wzi, having one of
the velues k,, k1—%,k1—- 26,..., —Ic1 and any eigenvalue mg, having one
of the values k2, kzwﬁ, k2—2?i,..., ““""“k2, and this ket is an eigenket
of M, belonging to the eigenvalue M Q = waiz-l-mgz. The possible
values of M; are thus k1+k2’k1+k2““%, k1+k2~2?£,...,-k1-k2, and
the number of times each of them occurs is given by the following
scheme (if we assume for definiteness that k1 2 k2),</p>
<p>kl-i-kz,k,+k,-+¥i,k,+k,-2%,...,k1—k,,k,—1c2—?£,...</p>
<p>1 2 3  2102-]- 1 2102-}- 1 (46)</p>
<p>2k,+1 2k,  1</p>
<p>Now each eigenvalue K‘ of K will be associated with the eigenvalues
KQIC-ﬁ, K'-~2%,..., WK’ for M5, with the same number of indepen-
dent simultaneous eigenkets ofK and JIQ for each of them. The total
number of independent eigenkets of M, belonging to any eigenvalue
M; must be the same, whether we take them to be simultaneous
eigenkets of m1, and m2, or simultaneous eigenkets of K and 1%, i.e.
it is always given by the scheme (46). It follows that the eigenvalues</p>

<p>and that for each of these eigenvalues for K and an eigenvalue for</p>
<p>14S ELEMENTARY APPLICATIONS §36</p>
<p>M, going with it there is just one independent simultaneous eigenket
of K and Mg.</p>
<p>The effect of rotations on eigenkets of angular momentum variables
should be noted. Take any eigenket {ML} of the z component of total
angular momentum for any dynamical system, and apply to it a small
rotation through an angle Bqﬁ about the z-axis. It will change into</p>
<p>&lt;1+8¢ri&gt;|M;&gt;' = (1—i8¢i%/%)lﬂf;&gt;
with the help of (32). This equals
&lt;1—r»15¢M;/%&gt;1M;&gt; = B"*S¢M§"‘IML&gt;</p>
<p>to the ﬁrst order in 8d». Thus 1M Q) gets multiplied by the numerical
factor e'-‘3¢M5l”. By applying a succession of these small rotations, We
ﬁnd that the application of a ﬁnite rotation through an angle gb about
the z-axis causes {M1,} to get multiplied by e"'3¢M5"". Putting qS = 2w,
we find that an application of one revolution about the z-axis leaves
IMQ) unchanged if the eigenvalue M; is an integral multiple of h and
causes IM 1,) to change sign ifM; is half an odd integral multiple of 6.
Now consider an eigenket |K’&gt; of the magnitude K of the total angu-
lar momentum. If the eigenvalue K’ is an integral multiple of h, the
possible eigenvalues of M are all integral multiples of h and the applica-
tion of one revolution about the z-axis must leave IK’) unchanged.
Conversely, if K’ is half an odd integral multiple of h, the possible eigen-
values of M, are all half odd integral multiples of ii and the revolution
must change the sign of IK’). From symmetry, the application of a
revolution about any other axis must have the same effect on [K ’&gt;
as one about the z-axis. We thus get the general result, the application
0f one revolution about any axis leaves a ket unchanged or changes its
sign according to whether it belongs to eigenvalues of the magnitude of
the total angular momentum. which are integral or half odd integral
multiples of 5. A state, of course, is always unaffected by the revolu-</p>
<p>tion, since a state is unaffected by a change of sign of the ket corre-
sponding to it.</p>
<p>For a dynamical system involving only orbital angular momenta,</p>
<p>a ket must be unchanged by a revolution about an axis, since we can
set up Schrodinger's representation, with the coordinates of all the</p>
<p>particles diagonal, and the Schrodinger representative of a ket will</p>
<p>get brought back to its original value by the revolution. It follows
that the eigerivnlues of the magnitude of an orbital angular momentum</p>
<p>are always integral multiples of h. The eigenvalues of a component</p>
<p>§33 PROPERTIES OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM 149</p>
<p>of an orbital angular momentum are also always integral multiples
of a5. For a spin angular momentum, Schrodinger's representation
does not exist and both kinds of eigenvalue are possible.</p>

<li>The spin of the electron</li>

<p>Electrons, and also some of the other fundamental particles (pro-
tons, neutrons) have a spin whose magnitude is éfi. This is found
from experimental evidence, and also there are theoretical reasons
showing that this spin value is more elementary than any other, even
spin Zero (see Chapter XI). The study of this particular spin is there-</p>
<p>fore of special importance.

to be diagonal. If there are no other independent dynamical variables
besides the 1113s or o’s in our dynamical system, then a, by itself forms
a complete set of commuting observables, since the form of equations
(50) and (51) is such that we cannot construct out of om, oy, and 0-,,
any new dynamical variable that commutes with U5. The diagonal
elements of the matrix representing Oz being the eigenvalues 1 and

<p>gives us

<p>The representative of a ket vector will consist of just two numbers,
corresponding to the two values -|- 1 and -1 for 0;. These two num-
bers form a function of the variable o’; whose domain consists of only
the two points + I and — I. The state for which 0-,, has the value unity
will be represented by the function, fc,,(o~f,) say, consisting of the pair
of numbers 1, O and that for which a, has the value —l will be
represented by the function, f,9(a_§,) say, consisting of the pair O, l.
Any function of the variable 0;, i.e. any pair of numbers, can be
expressed as a linear combination of these two. Thus any state can
be obtained by superposition of the two states for which o, equals + 1 ana’
— I respectively. For example, the state for which the component of
c: in the direction l, m, n, represented by (54), has the value +1 is
represented by the pair of numbers a, b which satisfy</p>

For the complete description of an electron (or other elementary
particle with spin Q5) we require the spin dynamical variables o,
whose connexion with the spin angular momentum is given by (48),
together with the Cartesian coordinates x, y, z and momenta 39x, p”,</p>
<p>39,. The spin dynamical variables commute with these coordinates
and momenta. Thus a complete set of commuting observables for a
system consisting of a single electron will be m, y, z, Uzi In a repre-
sentation in which these are diagonal, the representative of any state</p>
<p>162 ELEMENTARY APPLICATIONS §37</p>
<p>will be a function of four variables x', y', z’, 0;. Since a; has a domain
consisting of only two points, namely 1 and — l , this function of four</p>

Thus the presence cf the spin may be considered either as introducing a</p>

<li>Motion in a central ﬁeld of force</li>
</ol>
<p>An atom consists of a massive positively charged nucleus together
with a number of electrons moving round, under the inﬂuence of the
attractive force of the nucleus and their own mutual repulsions. An
exact treatment of this dynamical system is a very difﬁcult mathe-
matical problem. One can, however, gain some insight into the main
features of the system by making the rough approximation of regard-
ing each electron as moving independently in a certain central field
of force, namely that of the nucleus, assumed fixed, together with
some kind of average of the forces due to the other electrons. Thus
our present problem of the motion of a particle in a central field of
force forms a corner-stone in the theory of the atom.</p>
<p>Let the Cartesian coordinates of the particle, referred to a system
of axes with the centre of force as origin, be x, y, z and the corre-
sponding components of momentum p,, p,,, p,. The Hamiltonian,
Wit-h neglect of relativistic mechanics, will be of the form</p>
<p>H = 1f2m-(29i+29§+2@§)+T/, (57)
where V, the potential energy, is a function only of (x2+y2+z2). To
develop the theory it is convenient to introduce polar dynamical</p>
<p>variables. We introduce first the radius r, defined as the positive
square root r = (x2+y2+z2)*.</p>
<p>Its eigenvalues go from 0 to 0o. If we evaluate its P.B.s with p,, p,,,</p>

= x.:v/r-|-y.y/r+z.z/r = r.
Hence [@2913 = 1
or rpf-prr = 11%.</p>
<p>The commutation relation between 1" and p, is just the one for a
canonical coordinate and momentum, namely equation (10) of § 22.
This makes p,,. like the momentum conjugate to the r coordinate, but
it is not exactly equal to this momentum because it is not real, its
conjugate complex being</p>

Thus p,.--i?i¢"1 is real and is the true momentum conjugate to r.
The angular momentum In of the particle about the origin is given
by (22) and its magnitude k is given by (39). Since r and p, are
scalars, they commute With m, and therefore also With k.</p>
<p>We can express the Hamiltonian in terms of r, p,, and k. We have,</p>

<p>This equation may be used to determine the energy-levels H' cf the
system. For each solution X0 of (69), arising from a given n, there
will be 2n+l independent states, because there are 2n+1 indepen-
dent solutions of (67) corresponding to the 2n+1 different values
that a component of the angular momentum, m, say, can take on.
The probability of the particle being in an element of volume
dxdydz is proportional to IQMZdxdydz. With ip of the form ( 6 6) this
becomes r-2|X]2|S,,|2dxdydz. The probability of the particle being in
a spherical shell between r and r-j-dr is then proportional to lXlzdr.
It now becomes clear that, in solving equation ( 68) or (69), we must
impose a boundary condition on the function X at r = 0, namely the
function must be such that the integral to the origin I [Xlzdr is
0</p>
<p>convergent. If this integral were not convergent, the wave function
would represent a state for which the chances are infinitely in favour
of the particle being at the origin and such a state would not be
physically admissible.</p>
<p>The boundary condition at r = 0 obtained by the above considera-
tion of probabilities is, however, not sufficiently stringent. We get a
more stringent condition by verifying that the wave functionobtained
by solving the wave equation in polar coordinates (63) really satisfies
the wave equation in Cartesian coordinates (61). Let us take the case</p>
<p>156 ELEMENTARY APPLICATIONS § 33</p>
<p>of V .1 0, giving us the problem of the free particle. Applied t0 a
stationary state with energy H‘ = 0, equation (61) gives</p>
<p>v%=a (W)</p>
<p>where V2 is written for the Laplacian operator 82/8x2-1-82/8y24-89/8z2,
and equation (63) gives</p>

<p>r 55:5 7.22"“</p>
<p>A solution of (71) for 1c =1 0 is 1/1 r T'"1. This does not satisfy
(70), since,although Var-l vanishes for any ﬁnite value of r, its integral
through a volume containing the origin is —--4m' (as may be veriﬁed
by transforming this voiume integral to a surface integral by means
of Gauss's theorem), and hence</p>
<p>V2r""1 = -—-4w3(m)3(y)8(z). (72)</p>
<p>Thus not every solution of (7l) gives a solution of ('70), and more
generally, not every solution of (63) is a solution of (6l). We must
impose on the solution of (63) the condition that it shall not tend to
infinity as rapidly as 1W1 when r -+ O in order that, when substituted
into (61), it shall not give a 8 function on the right like the right-hand
side of (72). Only when equation (63)is supplemented with this condi-
tion does it become equivalent to equation (61). We thus have the
boundary condition n]; --:~ O or X e 0 as 1* --&gt; 0.</p>
<p>There are also boundary conditions for the wave function at r = 0o.
If we are interested only in ‘closed’ states, i.e. states for which the
particle does not go oif to inﬁnity, we must restrict the integral to</p>
<p>infinity I {X(r)]2 d?" to be convergent. These closed states, however,
are not the only ones that are physically permissible, as we can also
have states in which the particle arrives from infinity, is scattered
by the central field of force, and goes oif to inﬁnity again. For these
states the wave function may remain finite as r e» o0. Such states will
be dealt with in Chapter VIII under the heading of collision problems.
In any case the wave function must not tend to infinity as r -&gt; o0, or
it will represent a state that has no physical meaning.</p>

tend to Zero with r. The series (77) must therefore terminate on the

For large values of s the ratio of successive terms is</p>
<p>cs __ 2i‘</p>
<p>08,1 sa</p>
<p>according t0 (78). Thus the series (77) will always converge, as the
ratios of the higher terms to one another are the same as for the</p>
<p>series
1 (Zry (79)</p>
<p>2 a a =
S
which converges to cw“.</p>
<p>We must now examine how our solution X0 behaves for large
values of r. We must distinguish between the two cases of H' positive
and H’ negative. For H' negative, a given by (75) will be real. Sup-
pose we take the positive value for a. Then as r -+oo the sum of the
series (7 7) will tend to inﬁnity according to the same law as the sum
of the series (79), i.e. the law e27“. Thus, from (74), X0 will tend to
inﬁnity according to the law e7“ and will not represent a physically
possible state. There is therefore in general no permissible solution
of (73) for negative values of H‘. An exception arises, however, when-
ever the series (77 ) terminates on the side of large s, in which case the
boundary conditions are all satisﬁed. The condition for this termina-
tion of the series is that the coefficient of 08d in (78) shall vanish for
some value of the suffix s— l not less than its minimum value n-i- 1,
which is the same as the condition that</p>
<p>s me?</p>
<p>wan-u-
jin-piii-u- i</p>
<p>aﬁz</p>
<p>for some integer s not less than n+1. With the help of (75) this</p>
<p>condition becomes me4
H z H2327?’ (80)</p>
<p>and is thus a condition for the energy-level H’. Since s may be any
positive integer, the formula (80) gives a discrete set of negative
energy-levels for the hydrogen atom. These are in agreement with
experiment. For each of them (except the. lowest one s = 1) there
are several independent states, as there are various possible values
for n, namely any positive or zero integer less than s. This multi-
plicity of states belonging to an energy-levelis in addition to that
mentioned in the preceding section arising from the various possible</p>
<p>§39 ENERGY-LEVELS OF THE HYDROGEN ATOM 159</p>
<p>values for a component of angular momentum, which latter multi-
plicity occurs with any central ﬁeld of force. The n multiplicity occurs
only with an inverse square law of force and even then is removed
when one takes relativistic mechanics into account, as will be found
in Chapter XI. The solution X0 of (73) when H’ satisﬁes (80) tends to
zero exponentially as 1" -—&gt;~ c0 and thus represents a closed state (corre-
sponding to an elliptic orbit in Bohr-ﬁe theory).</p>
<p>For any positive values of H’, a given by (75)Will be pure imaginary.
The series (77), which is like the series (7 9)for large r, will now have a
sum that remains ﬁnite as 1* -+ o0. Thus X0 given by (74)will now remain
ﬁnite as r -&gt;~ oo and will therefore be a permissible solution of (7 3),
givinga wave function 5b that tends to zero according to the law ?""1 as
-r -+ oo. Hence in addition to the discrete set of negative energy-levels
(80), all positive energy-levels are allowed. The states of positive</p>
<p>m</p>
<p>energy are not closed, since for them the integral to inﬁnity I [Xolzdr
does not converge. (These states correspond to the hyperbolic orbits</p>
<p>of Bohfs theory.)</p>
<ol>
<li>Selection rules</li>
</ol>
<p>If a dynamical system is set up in a certain stationary state, it will
remain in that stationary state so long as it is not acted upon by
outside forces. Any atomic system in practice, however, frequently
gets acted upon by external electromagnetic ﬁelds, under whose
inﬂuence it is liable to cease to be in one stationary state and to make
a transition to another. The theory of such transitions will be de-
veloped in §§ 44 and 45. A result of this theory is that, to a high degree
of accuracy, transitions between two states cannot occur under the
inﬂuence of electromagnetic radiation if, in a Heisenberg representa-
tion with these two stationary states as two of the basic states, the
matrix element, referring to these two states, of the representative
of the total electric displacement D of the system vanishes. Now it
happens for many atomic systems that the great majority of the
matrix elements of D in a Heisenberg representation do ‘vanish, and
hence there are severe limitations on the possibilities for transitions.
The rules that express these limitations are called selection rules.</p>
<p>The idea of selection rules can be reﬁned by a more detailed
application of the theory of §§ 44 and 45, according to ‘which
the matrix elements of the different Cartesian components of the
vector D are associated with different states of polarization of the</p>
<p>160 ELEMENTARY APPLICATIONS §40</p>
<p>electromagnetic radiation. The nature of this association is just what
one would get if one considered the matrix elements, or rather their
real parts, as the amplitudes of harmonic oscillators which interact
with the ﬁeld of radiation according to classical electrodynamics.
There is a general method for obtaining all selection rules, as
follows. Let us call the constants of the motion which are diagonal in
the Heisenberg representation a's and let D be one of the Cartesian
components of D. We must obtain an algebraic equation connecting
D and the afs which does not involve any dynamical variables other
than D and the a's and which is linear in D. Such an equation will</p>
<p>f h f
bgo t € Onn Zfr-DQrIOa </p>
<p>where the fjs and gfs are functions of the hfs only. If this equation
is expressed in terms of representatives, it gives us</p>
<p>§f.(~')<a'|1>h"&gt;g.e"&gt; === 0.
or &lt;&lt;&gt;=’|Dl@”&gt; §fr(&lt;!’)9,(e") == 0,
which shows that <a'|1>|h"&gt; = 0 11111655
Zfr(@¢')9'r(e”) =Y 0- (82)</p>
<p>This last equation, giving the connexion which must exist between
a’ and ca" in order that (o¢’|D|h¢") may not vanish, constitutes the
selection rule, so far as the component D of D is concerned.</p>
<p>Our work on the harmonic oscillator in § 34 provides an example
of a selection rule. Equation (8)is of the form (8l)with 1'9’ for D and
H playing the part of the ofs, and it shows that the matrix elements
(H' ]5§|H”&gt; of 6;‘ all vanish except those for which H”--H’ = 15w. The
conjugate complex of this result is thatthe matrix elements (H' h; 1H”)
of 1) all vanish except those for which H — H' = -?iw. Since q is a
numerical multiple of vq-ﬁ, its matrix elements (H’|g|H”&gt; all vanish
except those for which H"--—H’ = iﬁw. If the harmonic oscillator
carries an electric charge, its electric displacement D will be pro-
portional to q. The selection rule is then that only those transitions
can take place in which the energy H changes by a single quan-
tum 15w.</p>
<p>We shall now obtain the selection rules for m, and l: for an electron
moving in a central ﬁeld of force. The components.of electric dis~</p>
<p>§40 SELECTION RULES 161</p>
<p>placement are here proportional to the Cartesian coordinates x, y, z.
Taking ﬁrst mg, we have that m5 commutes with z, or that</p>
<p>mzzwzmz = 0.</p>
<p>This is an equation of the required type (81), giving us the selection</p>
<p>rule ,
mz-m; = 0</p>
<p>for the z-component of the displacement. Again, from equations
(23)we have [mzlmzaxn = [may] = um
or mﬁas-Qmzxmz-i-xmﬁ-lﬁx = 0,
which is also of the type (81) and gives us the selection rule
mff-2m:,m;+m;2—h2 = 0</p>
<p>or (m;-m;’—-ﬁ)(m;-—m;+ﬁ) = O</p>
<p>for the x-component of the displacement. The selection rule for the
y-component is the same. Thus our selection rules for m5 are that
in transitions associated with radiation with a polarization corresponding
to an electric dipole in the Z-direction, m; cannot change, while in transi-
tions associated with a polarization corresponding to an electric dipole
in the x-direction or y-direction, m; mast change by iii-</p>
<p>We can determine more accurately the state of polarization of the
radiation associated with a transition in which m; changes by iii, by
considering the condition for the non-vanishing of matrix elements
of x+iy and x-iy. We have</p>
<p>[mwx-l-iy] = y-ix = —i(a;+iy)
or m,,(=v+iy)~—(=v+iy)(mz+%) = 0,
which is again of the type (81). It gives
mgﬂmg-li = O
as the condition that (mgx-l-iylmg) shall not vanish. Similarly,
mgp-mg-f-li = 0
is the condition that <m;]:c—iylm§> shall not vanish. Hence
<m.;|%"'5?1ImL-?i> = 0
0r <mélﬂ=lmlr~ﬁ> = Kmélylmkii) = (@+ib)@i""
say, a, b, and w being real. The conjugate complex of this is
<mg~hlxlmg> = -i<m;—-hjy§m;> = (a-ibyriw‘.</p>
<p>Thus the vector %{(m;|D[m;--h&gt;+<m;—-liID[mL>}, which determines</p>
<p>162 ELEMENTARY APPLICATIONS §4=0</p>
<p>the state of polarization of the radiation associated with transitions
for Which m; = mQ-izl, has the following three components</p>
<p>EKmL|xlﬂlkeﬁ&gt;+<mlrrﬁlxlmfa>l l
= +{(a+ib)e"W'+ (a--£b)e<em>iw‘} = a cos wt--b sin wt,

%{<m;1z]mf,——ﬁ>-|—(m;--?i]z|m;)} = 0. ,1</p>
<p>From the form of these components We see that the associated radia-
tion moving in the z-direction will be circularly polarized, that
moving in any direction in the zy-plane will be linearly polarized in
this plane, and that moving in intermediate directions Will be
elliptically polarized. The direction of circular polarization for radia-
tion moving in the z-direction Will depend on Whether W is positive
or negative, and this Will depend on Which of the tWo states m; or
m; = mg-fi, has the greater energy.
We shall now determine the selection rule for k. We have</p>

<p>Similarly, [kUc-l-iixaz] = Mymzumy 2:)
and [k(ic+?i),y] = 2(?TL$Z——1B’)7I/z).
Hence</p>

From (22) mxx-l-myy-f-mzz = 0 (84)
and hence

Which gives

--~2¥iz{k(lc+?el)z+zlc(k+fi)} .—.-_. 0. (85)</p>
<p>§40 SELECTION RULES 163</p>
<p>Similar equations hold for x and y. These equations are of the re-
quired type (81), and give us the selection rule</p>
<p>k’2(k’+¥i)2—2k’(k’-|-%)Ic”(k"+h)+k”2(lc”+ﬁ)2-
-2ﬁ2k’(k’+?i)-2ﬁ2k”(k”+h) = 0,
which reduces to
(k’+lc"+2ﬁ)(k’+k”)(k’—k"+fi)(lc’—-la"—-ﬁ) = 0.</p>
<p>A transition can take place between two states k’ and k” only if one
of these four factors vanishes.</p>
<p>Now the first of the factors, (Ic’-l-k”+2¥i), can never vanish, since
the eigenvalues of is are all positive or zero. The second, (id-l-lc”), can
vanish only if k’ = 0 and 7c" = 0. But transitions between two states
with these values for k cannot occur on account of other selection
rules, as may be seen from the following argument. If two states
(labelled respectively with a single prime and a double prime) are
such that 1c’ = 0 and k” = 0, then from (4])and the corresponding
results for mg and my, m; = m; = m; = 0 and  = m; = m; = O.
The selection rule for m, now shows that the matrix elements of
x and y referring to the two states must vanish, as the value of m,
does not change during the transition, and the similar selection rule
for ma, or my shows that the matrix element of z also vanishes. Thus
transitions between the two states cannot occur. Our selection rule</p>
<p>for 1c now reduces to
(Ic’-k”+r‘i)(k'—»k”-%) = 0,
showing that k must change by iii. This selection rule may be written
k’2--2k’k”+?a”2~—%2 = 0,</p>
<p>and since this is the condition that a matrix element (k’[z|k”&gt; shall
not vanish, we get the equation</p>
<p>lczz-ﬂlczlc-I-zliﬁwiﬂz = O
O1‘ [ks [ks  i "Z; </p>
<p>a result which could not easily be obtained in a more direct way.
As a final example we shall obtain the selection rule for the magni-
tude K of the total angular momentum M of a general atomic system.
Let x, y, z be the coordinates of one of the electrons. We must obtain
the condition that the (K', K ) matrix element of x, y, or z shall not
vanish. This is evidently the same as the condition that the (K’, K )
matrix element of A, A2, or A, shall not vanish, where A, A, and A,</p>
<p>164 ELEMENTARY APPLICATIONS §40</p>
<p>are any three independent linear functions of a3, y, and z with numeri-
cal coefﬁcients, or more generally with any coefficients that commute
with K and are thus represented by matrices which are diagonal with</p>
<p>respect to K. Let A0 : Mxx+Myy+mizza
A, = Myzwlﬂy-wlﬁx,
A, = MzxwMmzwiﬁy,
A, = MmywMyome-iﬁz.</p>
<p>We have</p>
<p>llIxhg-l-My Ay-l-Mzh, = Z (ﬂIxMyz—-Mxll4;y--@%M$x)</p>
<p>$115</p>
<p>xgﬂ-‘lfzﬂlzp-Myﬂfay-‘itﬁlllgﬁ r 0 (87)</p>
<p>from (29). Thus A, A, and A, are not linearly independent functions
of x, y, and z. Any two of them, however, together with A, are three
linearly independent functions of x, y, and z and may be taken as the
above A,, A,, A3, since the coefficients Mm, My, 1% all commute with K.
Our problem thus reduces to finding the condition that the (K ',K )
matrix elements of A,, A, A, and A, shall not vanish. The physical
meanings of these A's are that A, is proportional to the component of
the vector (x, y,z) in the direction of the vector M, and A, A, A, are
proportional to the Cartesian components of the component of (x, y, z)
perpendicular to M.</p>
<p>Since A, is a scalar it must commute xvith K. It follows that only
the diagonal elements <K’|)l,,|K'> of A, can differ from zero, so the
selection rule is that K cannot change so far as A0 is concerned. Apply-
ing (30)to the vector A, A,, A, we have</p>
<p>[llgjxx] z: Aw UM; T“ “Aw [EH21 A2] = 0'</p>
<p>These relations between M, and A, A,, A, are of exactly the same form
as the relations (23), (24)between m, and x,y,z, and also (8 7)is of
the same form as ( 8 4). The dynamical variables A, A,,, A, thus have the
same properties relative to the angular momenturn M as x, y, z have
relative to m. The deduction of the selection rule for k when the
electric displacement is proportional to (x, y, z) can therefore be taken
over and applied to the selection rule for K when the electric displace-
ment is proportional to (A,, A, A,). We find in this way that, so far as
A A, A, are concerned, the selection rule for K is that it must change
by iﬁ.</p>
<p>Collecting results, we have as the selection rule for K that it must
change by O or i5. We have considered the electric displacement</p>
<p>§40 SELECTION RULES 165</p>
<p>produced by only one of the electrons, but the same selection rule
must hold for each electron and thus also for the total electric dis-</p>
<p>placement.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Zeeman effect for the hydrogen atom</li>
</ol>
<p>We shall now consider the system of a hydrogen atom in a uniform
magnetic ﬁeld. The Harniltonian (5 7 )With V = —62/I',Wl1lCl1 describes
the hydrogen atom in no external ﬁeld, gets modiﬁed by the magnetic
ﬁeld, the modiﬁcation, according to classical mechanics, consisting
in the replacement of the components of momentum, pm, p”, pa, by
px-l-e/mAx, py+e/c.A,, pz-I-G/(LA, Where A,, A,, A, are the com-
ponents of the vector potential describing the ﬁeld. For a uniform
ﬁeld of magnitude A‘ in the direction of the x-axis We nlay take</p>
<p>A, = —%.#y, A, = évlaix, A, = 0. The classical Hamiltonian will
then be
_ 1 1 e 2 1 e 2 2 e2
H=%{( w""§zﬂ3i) d-(Py+§zﬂx) +Pz}"7-</p>
<p>This classical Hamiltonian may be taken over into the quantum
theory if We add on to it a term giving the effect of the spin of the
electron. According to experimental evidence and according to the
theory of Chapter XI , theelectron has a magnetic moment -—e?zZ/2*mc. a,
Where a is the spin vector of § 37. The energy of this magnetic moment
in the magnetic ﬁeld Will be eﬁﬁ/ 27110.02. Thus the total quantum</p>
<p>Harniltonian Will be</p>
<p>1 1 e 2 1 e 2 e2 eﬁﬂ
=<em>.</em> ........__ --_ﬁ 2 --- —---- . 88</p>
<p>There ought strictly to be other terms in this Hamiltonian giving the
interaction of the magnetic moment of the electron With the electric
ﬁeld of the nucleus of the atom, but this effect is small, of the same
order of magnitude as the correction one gets by taking relativistic
mechanics into account, and Will be neglected here. It mill be taken
into account in the relativistic theory of the electron given in
Chapter XI.</p>
<p>If the magnetic ﬁeld is not too large, we can neglect terms involving</p>
<h1>2, so that the Hamiltonian (88) reduces to</h1>

<p>3595.57 M</p>
<p>166 ELEMENTARY APPLICATIONS § 41</p>
<p>The extra terms due t0 the magnetic ﬁeld are now eﬂ/Qmc. (mz-l-ﬁaz).
But these extra terms commute with the total Hamiltonian and are
thus constants of the motion. This makes the problem very easy.
The stationary states of the system, i.e. the eigenstates of the Ha-mil-
tonian (89), will be those eigenstates of the Hamiltonian for no ﬁeld
that are simultaneously eigenstates of the observables m, and a,, or
at least of the one observable mz+%azs and the energy-levels of the
system will be those for the system with no ﬁeld, given by (80) if
one considers only closed states, increased by an eigenvalue of
eﬂ/QmcuQnzZ-l-haz). Thus stationary states of the system with no
ﬁeld for which m, has the numerical value mg, an integral multiple
of 11L, and for which also a, has the numerical value a; = i1, will still
be stationary states when the ﬁeld is applied. Their energy will be
increased by an amount consisting of the sum of two parts, a part
eﬂ/Qmcxm; arising from the orbital motion, which part may be con-
sidered as due to an orbital magnetic moment -—emf,/2ww, and a part
eﬂ/ 2772,0120; arising from the spin. The ratio of the orbital magnetic
moment to the orbital angular tcnomentum m; is --e/2mc, which is
half the ratio of the spin magnetic moment to the spin angular
momentum. This fact is sometimes referred to as the magnetic
anomaly of the spin.</p>
<p>Since the energy-levels now involve ma, the selection rule for m,
obtained in the preceding section becomes capable of direct com-
parison with experiment. We take a Heisenberg representation in
which, among other constants of the motion, m, and a, are diagonal.
The selection rule for m, now requires m, to change by 6, 0, or —6,
while a2, since it commutes with the electric displacement, will not
change at all. Thus the energy difference between the two states
taking part in the transition process will differ by an amount
eﬁﬂ/Zmc, 0, or “eﬁﬂ/Zmc from its value for no magnetic ﬁeld.
Hence, from Bohr's frequency condition, the frequency of the
associated electromagnetic radiation will differ by eﬂ/éwmc, 0, or
--—6ﬂ/41rm(3 from that for no magnetic ﬁeld. This means that each
spectral line for no magnetic ﬁeld gets split up by the ﬁeld into three
components. If one considers radiation moving in the z-direction,
then froln (83) the two outer components will be circularly polarized,
while the central undisplaced one will be of zero intensity. These
results are in agreement with experiment and also with the classical
theory of the Zeeman effect.</p>
