      <h1>VIII COLLISION PROBLEMS</h1>
<h1>48. General remarks</h1>
<p>IN this chapter We shall investigate problems connected With a par-
ticle Which, coming from inﬁnity, encounters or ‘collides With’ some
atomic system and, after being scattered through a certain angle, goes
off to inﬁnity again. The atomic system Which does the scattering
We shall call, for brevity, the scatterer. We thus have a dynamical
system composed of an incident particle and a scatterer interacting
with each other, Which We must deal With according to the laws of
quantum mechanics, and for Which We must, in particular, calculate
the probability of scattering through any given angle. The scatterer
is usually assumed to be of inﬁnite mass and to be at rest throughout
the scattering process. The problem was ﬁrst solved by Born by a
method substantially equivalent to that of the next section. We must
take into account the possibility that the scatterer, considered as a
system by itself, may have a number of different stationary states
and that if it is initially in one of these states when the particle arrives
from inﬁnity, it may be left in a different one when the particle goes
off to in. nity again. The colliding particle may thus induce transi-
tions in the scatterer.</p>
<p>The Hamiltonian for the Whole system of scatterer plus particle
will not involve the time explicitly, so that this Whole system will
have stationary states represented by periodic solutions of Schro-
dinger's Wave equation. The meaning of these stationary states
requires a little care to be properly understood. It is evident that
for any state of motion of the system the particle Will spend nearly all
its time at inﬁnity, so that the time average of the probability of the
particle being in any ﬁnite volume will be zero. Now for a stationary
state the probability of the particle being in a given ﬁnite volume,
like any other result of observation, must be independent of the time,
and hence this probability will equal its time average, Which We have
seen is zero. Thus only the relative probabilities of the particle being
in different ﬁnite volumes will be physically signiﬁcant, their absolute
values being all zero. The total energy of the system has a continuous
range of eigenvalues, since the initial energy of the particle can be
anything. Thus a ket, ls) say, corresponding to a stationary state,</p>
<p>186 COLLISION PROBLEMS §43</p>
<p>being an eigenket of the total energy, must be of inﬁnite length. We
can see a physical reason for this, since if 1s) were normalized and if
Q denotes that observable—a certain function of the position of
the particle—that is equal to unity if the particle is in a given ﬁnite
volume and zero otherwise, then &lt;s|Q|.s-) would be zero, meaning that
the average value of Q, i.e. the probability of the particle being in the
given volume, is zero. Such a ket Is) would not be a convenient one
to work with. However, with 1s) of inﬁnite length, &lt;s]Q|.s) can be
ﬁnite and would then give the relative probability of the particle
being in the given volume.</p>
<p>In picturing a state of a system corresponding to a ket |:v) which
is not normalized, but for which (xlx) = n say, it may be convenient
to suppose that we have n similar systems all occupying the same
space but with no interaction between them, so that each one follows
out its own motion independently of the others, as we had in the
theory of the Gibbs ensemble in § 33. We can then interpret &lt;x|a|x),
where o: is any observable, directly as the total o: for all the n systems.
In applying these ideas to the above-mentioned 1s) of inﬁnite length,
corresponding to a stationary state of the system of scatterer plus
colliding particle, we should picture an inﬁnite number of such sys-
tems with the scatterers all located at the same point and the particles
distributed continuously throughout space. The number of particles
in a given finite volume would be pictured as (slQls), Q being the
observable deﬁned above, which has the value unity when the particle
is in the given volume and zero otherwise. If the ket is represented
by a Schrodinger wave function involving the Cartesian coordinates
of the particle, then the square of the modulus of the wave function
could be interpreted directly as the density of particles in the picture.
One must remember, however, that each 0f these particles has its own
individual scatterer. Different particles may belong to scatterers in
different states. There will thus be one particle density for each state
of the scatterer, namely the density of those particles belonging to
scatterers in that state. This is taken account of by the wave function
involving variables describing the state of the scatterer in addition
to those describing the position of the particle.</p>
<p>For determining scattering coefﬁcients we have to investigate
stationary states of the whole system of scatterer plus particle. For
instance, if we want to determine the probability of scattering in
various directions when the scatterer is initially in a given stationary</p>
<p>§48 GENERAL REMARKS 187</p>
<p>state and the incident particle has initially a given velocity in a given
direction, we must investigate that stationary state of the whole
system whose picture, according to the above method, contains at
great distances from the point of location of the scatterers only
particles moving with the given initial velocity and direction and
belonging each to a scatterer in the given initial stationary state,
together with particles moving oatzaard from the point of location
of the scatterers and belonging possibly to scatterers in various
stationary states. This picture corresponds closelyto the actual state
of affairsin an experimental determination of scattering coefficients,
with the difference that the picture really describes only one actual
system of scatterer plus particle. The distribution of outward moving
particles at infinity in the picture gives us immediately all the infor-
mation about scattering coefficients that could be obtained by experi-
ment. For practical calculations about the stationary state described
by this picture one may use a perturbation method somewhat like
that of § 43, taking as unperturbed system, for example, that for
which there is no interaction between the scatterer and particle.</p>
<p>In dealing with collision problems, a further possibility to be taken
into consideration is that the scatterer may perhaps be capable of
absorbing and re-emitting the particle. This possibility arises when
there exists one or more states 0f absorption of the whole system, a
state of absorption being an approximately stationary state which
is closed in the sense mentioned at the end of § 38 (Le. for which
the probability of the particle being at a greater distance than r from
the scatterer tends to zero as r -&gt; oo). Since a state of absorption is
only approximately stationary, its property of being closed will be
only a transient one, and after a sufficient lapse of time there will be
a ﬁnite probability of the particle being on its way to infinity.
Physically this means there is a finite probability of spontaneous
emission of the particle. The fact that we had to use the word
‘approximately’ in stating the conditions required for the phenomena
of emission and absorption to be able to occur shows that these condi-
tions are not expressible in exact mathematical language. One can give
a meaning to thesephenomena. only with reference to a perturbation
method. They occur when the unperturbed system (of scatterer plus
particle) has stationary states that are closed. The introduction of the
perturbation spoils the stationary property of these states and gives
rise to spontaneous emission and its converse absorption.</p>
<p>188 COLLISION PROBLEMS § 48</p>
<p>For calculating absorption and emission probabilities it is necessary
t0 deal with non-stationary states of the system, in contradistinction
t0 the case for scattering coefficients, so that the perturbation method
of § 44 must be used. Thus for calculating an emission coefﬁcient
we must consider the non-stationary states of absorption described
above. Again, since an absorption is always followed by a re-emission,
it cannot be distinguished from a scattering in any experiment in-
volving a steady state of affairs, corresponding to a stationary state
of the system. The distinction can be made only by reference to a
non-steady state of affairs, eg. by use of a stream of incident particles
that has a sharp beginning, so that the scattered particles will appear
immediately after the incident particles meet the scatterers, while
those that have been absorbed and re-emitted will begin to appear
only some time later. This stream of particles would be the picture
of a certain ket of inﬁnite length, which could be used for calculating
the absorption coefﬁcient.</p>
<ol>
<li>The scattering coefﬁcient</li>
</ol>
<p>We shall now consider the calculation of scattering coefﬁcients,
taking first the case when there is no absorption and emission, which
means that our unperturbed system has no closed stationary states.
We may conveniently take this unperturbed system to be that for
which there is no interaction between the scatterer and particle. Its
Hamiltonian will thus be of the form</p>
<p>E = H,+ W, (1)</p>
<p>where H, is that for the scatterer alone and W that for the particle
alone, namely, with neglect of relativistic mechanics,</p>
<p>W = I/Zmtpi-i-pi-l-pﬁ). (2)
The perturbing energy V, assumed small, will now be a function of
the Cartesian coordinates of the particle x, y, z, and also, perhaps,
of its momenta p,, p,,, p,, together with dynamical variables describ-
ing the scatterer.</p>
<p>Since ‘we are now interested only in stationary states of the whole
system, we use a perturbation method like that of $43. Our unper-
turbed system now‘ necessarily has a continuous range of energy-
levels, since it contains a free particle, and this gives rise to certain
modificationsin the perturbation method. The question of the change
in the energy-levels caused by the perturbation, which was the main</p>
<p>§49 THE SCATTEEING COEFFICIENT 189</p>
<p>question of § 43, no longer has a meaning, and the convention in § 43
of using the same number of primes to denote nearly equal eigen-
values of E and H now drops out. Again, the splitting of energy-
levels which we had in§ 43 when the unperturbed system is degenerate
cannot now arise, since if the unperturbed system is degenerate the
perturbed one, which must also have a contiriuous range of energy-
levels, will also be degenerate to exactly the same extent.</p>
<p>We again use the general scheme of equations developed at the
beginning of § 43, equations (l) to (4) there, but we now take our
unperturbed stationary state forming the zero-order approximation
to belong to an energy-level E’ just equal to the energy-level H’ of
our perturbed stationary state. Thus the a's introduced in the second
of equations (3)§ 43 are now all zero and the second of equations</p>
<p>(4) there now reads (E,___E)|1&gt; H: mo) (3)</p>
<p>Similarly, the third of equations (4)§ 43 now reads
(E'—E)]2&gt; = V|1&gt;. (4)</p>
<p>We shall proceed to solve equation (3) and to obtain the scattering
coefficient to the ﬁrst order. We shall need equation (4) in §5l.</p>
<p>Let o: denote a complete set of commuting observables describing
the scatterer, which are constants of the motion when the scatterer is
alone and may thus be used for labelling the stationary states of the
scatterer. This requires that HS shall commute with the a's and be
a function of them. We can now take a representation of the whole
system in which the 03s and x, y, z, the coordinates of the particle,
are diagonal. This will make H3 diagonal. Let l0) be represented by
(x0410) and 11&gt; by (Xe/ll), the single variable x being written to
denote x, y, z and the prime being omitted from x for brevity. Also
the single differential d3x will be written to denote the product dxdydz.
Equation (3), written in terms of representatives, becomes,with the
help of (l)and (2),</p>

Suppose that the incident particle has the momentum p" and that

<p>Our problem now is to obtain a solution (Xe/II) of (7) which, for
values of X, y, z denoting points far from the scatterer, represents
only outward moving particles. The square of its modulus, Kxu’ ll) [2,
will then give the density of scattered particles belonging to scatterers
in the state a’ when the density of the incident particles is |<X<x°|0>|2,</p>
<p>which is unity. If we transform to polar coordinates 1*, 6, g6, equation
(7) becomes</p>

Now F must tend to zero as r -—&gt;- oo, on account of the physical re-
quirement that the interaction energy between the scatterer and</p>
<p>particle must tend to zero as the distance between them tends to
inﬁnity. If we neglect F in (l l)altogether, an approximate solution</p>
<p>for large r is Qacibofll) = u(6q5a,),__16.,;;,,, (12)</p>
<p>where u is an arbitrary function of 6, g8, and a’, since this expression
substituted in the left-hand side of (l l) gives a result of order P3.
When we do not neglect F , the solution of (ll) will still be of the
form (l2) for large v", provided F tends to zero sufficiently rapidly as
r --&gt; co, but the function u will now be definite and determined by the
solution for smaller values of r.</p>
<p>For values a' of the 08s such that k2, deﬁned by (8), is positive, the
k in (l2) must be chosen to be the positive square root of k2, in order
that (12) may represent only outward moving particles, Le. particles
for which the radial component of momentum, which from § 38
equals p,.—-'i%o~-1 or -i%(8/6r+r*1), has a positive value. We now
have that the density of scattered particles belonging to scatterers in
state a', equal to the square of the modulus of (12), falls olf with
increasing r according to the inverse square law, as is physically</p>

servation of energy. For values a' of the a's such that k2 is negative

cient for the scatterer to be left in the state a’.</p>
<p>We must now evaluate uwqﬁa’) for a set of values a’ for the 03s such
that E2 is positive, and obtain the angular distribution of the scattered
particles belonging to scatterers in state a‘. It is sufficient to evaluate
u for the direction B = 0 of the pole of the polar coordinates, since
this direction is arbitrary. We make use of Green's theorem, Which
states that for any two functions of position A and B the ivolume
integral  (AV2B—BV2A)d3srr taken over any volume equals the
surface integral J (Aﬁlﬁ/ﬁnﬂﬁﬁAftm) as taken over the boundary

<p>This is the scattering coefficient for transitions 010+ a’ of the scatterer.
It depends on that matrix element <p’a’lVlp°oi°> of the perturbing
energy V whose column p°a° and whose row phi’ refer respectively to
the initial and final states of the unperturbed system, between which
the (scattering transition process takes place. The result (15) is thus
in some ways analogous to the result (24) of § 44, although the
numerical coefficients are different in the two cases, corresponding
to the different natures of the two transition processes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Solution with the momentum representation</li>
</ol>
<p>The result (15) for the scattering coefficient makes a reference only
to that representation in which the momentum p is diagonal. One
would thus expect to be able to get a more direct proof of the result
by working all the time in the p-representation, instead of working
in the x-representation and transforming at the end to the p-repre-
sentation, as was done in § 49. This would not at first sight appear
to be a great improvement, as the lack of directness of the x-repre-
sentation method is offset by more direct applicability, it being
possible to picture the square of the modulus of the X-representative
of a state as the density of a stream of particles in process of being
scattered. The x-representation method has, however, other more
serious disadvantages. One of the main applications of the theory
of collisions is to the case of photons as .incident particles. Now a
photon is not a simple particle but has a polarization. It is evident
from classical electromagnetic theory that a photon with a definite
momentum, i.e. one moving in a definite direction with a definite
frequency, may have a definite state of polarization (linear, circular,
etc.), while a photon with a definite position, which is to be pictured
as an electromagnetic disturbance confined to a very small volume,
cannot have any definite polarization. These facts mean that the
polarization observable of a photon commutes with its momentum
but not with its position. This results in the p-representation method
being immediately applicable to the case of photons, it being only
necessary to introduce the polarizing variable into the representatives
and treat it along with the afs describing the scatterer, while the</p>
<p>194 COLLISION PROBLEMS §50</p>
<p>x-representation method is not applicable. Further, in dealing with
photons, it is necessary to take relativistic mechanics into account.
This can easily be done in the p-representation method, but not so
easily in the x-representation n1ethod.</p>

<p>If in the new representation we take the weight function P2 sin w,
then the ureight attached to any volume of p-space will be the same
as in the previous p-representation, so that the transformation will
mean simply a relabelling of the rows and columns of the matrices
without any alteration of the matrix elements. Thus (20) will become
in the new representation</p>

<p>W being now a function of the single variable P.</p>
<p>§5O SOLUTION WITH MOMENTUM REPRESENTATION 195</p>
<p>The coefficient of (Pwxaafll), namely Wi-W, is now simply a
multiplying factor and not a differential operator as it was with the
x-representation method. We can therefore divide out by this factor
and obtain an explicit expression for (Pwxaﬂl). When, however, a’
is such that W’, defined by (18), is greater than mcz, this factor will
have the value zero for a certain point in the domain of the variable
P, namely the point P = P’, given in terms of W’ by (I 6). The
function (Pwxcfll) will then have a singularity at this point. This
singularity shows that (Pa) X0111) represents an infinite number of
particles moving about at great distances from the scatterers with
energies indefinitely close to W’ and it is therefore this singularity
that we have to study to get the angular distribution of the particles</p>
<p>at infinity.
The result of dividing out (2 l) by the factor W'—--W is, according</p>
<p>to (13) of§ l5,</p>
<p>(Pwxofﬂ) := h‘3'<PwXcx’[V[P0w°X°o¢°>/( W'— IV)—]—A(wXa') 3( W'— W),
(22)</p>
<p>where A is an arbitrary function of w, X, and a’. To give a meaning
to the first term on the right-hand side of (22), we make the conven-
tion that its integral with respect to P over a range that includes the
value P’ is the limit when e+O of the integral when the small
domain Pﬂ-e to P’—f—e is excluded from the range of integration.
This is sufficient to make the meaning of (22) precise, since we are
interested effectively only in the integrals of the representatives of
states when the representation has continuous ranges of rows and
columns. We see that equation (2 I )is inadequate to determine the

We see in this way that the condition that (r6951) shall represent

<p>From this general result we can infer that, whenever we have a
representative <PcoXI> representing only outward moving particles
and satisfying an equation of the type (23), the number per unit solid
angle per unit time of these particles is given by (3 6).lf this (Pwpd)

<ol>
<li>Dispersive scattering</li>
</ol>
<p>We shall now determine the scattering when the incident particle
is capable of being absorbed, that is, when our unperturbed system
of scatterer plus particle has closed stationary states with the particle
absorbed. The,existence of these closed states for the unperturbed
system will be found to have a considerable effect on the scattering
for the perturbed system, and indeed an effect that depends very
much on the energy of the incident particle, giving rise to the pheno-
menon of dispersion in optics when the incident particle is taken to
be a photon.</p>
<p>We use a representation for which the basic kets correspond to
the stationary states of the unperturbed system, as was the case with
the p-representation of the preceding section. We take these station-
ary states to be the states (p’oc') for which the particle has a definite
momentum p’ and the scatterer is in a definite state a’, together with
the closed states, k say, which form a separate discrete set, and
assume that these states are all independent and orthogonal. This
assumption is not accurate when the particle is an electron or atomic
nucleus, since in this case for an absorbed state k the particle will
still certainly be somewhere, so that one would expect to be able to
expand |Zc&gt; in terms of the eigenkets lxh’) of x, y, z, and the ofs,
and hence also in terms of the ip’oi’&gt;’s. On the other hand, when the
particle is a photon it “will no longer exist for the absorbed states,
which are then certainly independent of and orthogonal to the states
( p11’) for which the particle does exist. Thus the assumption is valid
in this case, which is an important practical one.</p>
<p>Since we are concerned with scattering, we must still deal with
stationary states of the whole system. We shall now, however, have
to work to the second order of accuracy, so that we cannot use merely</p>

<p>We may assume that the matrix elements (Ic'lV|Zc"&gt; of V vanish,

( 42 )that (M1) is of the ﬁrst order of smallness, provided E’ does not
lie near one of the discrete set of energy-levels Ek, and (poﬂl) is of

<p>The scattering may now be considered as composed of two parts,
a part that arises from the matrix element <p'a’lV|p°o¢") of the per-
turbing energy and a part that arises from the matrix elements
<p’@¢’|V|k) and <ic|V[p°o¢”>. The first part, which is the same as our
previously obtained result (38), may be called the direct scattering.
The second part may be considered as arising from an absorption of
the incident particle into some state k, followed immediately by a
re-emission in a different direction, and is like the transitions through
an intermediate state considered in $44. The fact that we have to
add the two terms before taking the square of the modulus denotes
interference between the two kinds of scattering. There is no experi-
mental way of separating the two kinds, the distinction between
them being only mathematical.</p>
<ol>
<li>Resonance scattering</li>
</ol>
<p>Suppose the energy of the incident particle to he varied con-
tinuously while the initial state a“ of the scatterer is kept fixed, so
that the total energy E’ or H’ varies continuously. The formula (44)
now shows that as E’ approaches one of the discrete set of energy-
levels Eh, the. scattering becomes very large. In fact, according to
formula (44)the scattering should be infinite when E’ is exactly equal
to an E,. An infinite scattering coefficient is, of course, physically
impossible, so that we can infer that the approximations used in
deriving (44) are no longer legitimate when E’ is close to an Ek. To
investigate the scattering in this case we must therefore go back to</p>
<p>the exact equation (E,_EHH,&gt; z VIE’),
equation (2) of § 43 with E’ written for H’, and use a different method</p>

<p>Let us take one particular EL. and consider the case when E’ is close
to it. The large term in the scattering coefficient ( 4 4 )now arises from
those elements of the matrix representing V that lie in row k or in
column k, i.e. those of the type (Icllﬂpof) or <po¢’]V|7c>. The scatter-
ing arising from the other matrix elements of V is of a smaller order
of magnitude. This suggests that in our exact equations ( 4 5 )we should
make the approximation of neglecting all the matrix elements of V
except the important ones, which are those of the type <poflV|k> or
<k|V|pQ¢'>, where a’ is a state of the scatterer that has not too much

One can obtain the total effective area that the incident particle
must hit in order to be scattered anywhere by integrating (5 3) over

E’ has the value Ek-l-a and the scattering Will be half its maximum
when E differs from this value by an amount b. The large amount of
scattering that occurs for values of the energy of the incident particle
that make E’ nearly equal to Eh. give rise to the phenomenon of an
absorption line. The centre of the line is displaced by an amount</p>

<li>Emission and absorption</li>
</ol>
<p>For studying entiission and absorption we must consider non-
stationary states of the system and must use the perturbation method
of § 44. To determine the coefficient of spontaneous emission we must
take an initial state for which the particle is absorbed, corresponding
to a ket I70), and determine the probability that at some later time
the particle shall be on its way to inﬁnity with a deﬁnite momentum.
The method of§ 46 can now be applied. From the result (39) of that
section we see that the probability per unit time per unit range of w
and X, of the particle being emitted in any direction w’, X’ With the
scatterer being left in state a is</p>
<p>21r5,”1|(li7'w'X'cx']VIZ/QR, (55)</p>
<p>provided, of course, that a’ is such that the energy W’, given by (18),
of the particle is greater than mo? For values of a’ that do not satisfy
this condition there is no emission possible. The matrix element
&lt; 'w’X’a']V]k&gt; here must refer to a representation in which W, w, X,
and a are diagonal with the weight function unity. The matrix
elements of V appearing in the three preceding sections refer to a repre-
sentation in which pa, p”, p, are diagonal with the weight function
unity, or P, w, X are diagonal with the weight function P2sinw.
They would thus refer to a representation in which W, w, X are
diagonal with the weight function dP/dlV.P2SiI1w = WP/cZsinw.
Thus the matrix element (I 'w'X'oc']V[]c&gt; in (55) is equal to
(W'P '/c2. sin w’? times our previous matrix element (W 'w’X’a’|V[Ic&gt;

<p>To obtain the total probability per unit time of the particle being

<p>must integrate (56) over all angles w’, x’ and sum over all states a’

just Zb/ii, where b is deﬁned by (51). There is thus this simple rela-
tion between the total emission coeﬂicient and the half-width b 0f the
absorption line.</p>
<p>Let us now consider absorption. This requires that we shall take
an initial state for which the particle is certainly not absorbed but is
incident with a definite momentum. Thus the ket corresponding to
the initial state must be of the form (19). We must now determine
the probability of the particle being absorbed after time t. Since our
ﬁnal state h is not one of a continuous range, we cannot use directly
the result (39) of$46. If, however, we take</p>
<p>i ipoao&gt;s 
as the ket corresponding to the initial state, the analysis of §§ 44 and 46</p>
<p>is still applicableas far as equation (3 6)and shows us that the proba-
bility of the particle being absorbed into state h after time t is</p>

This corresponds to a distribution of incident particles of density
72:4, owing to the omission of the factor h? from (57), as compared
with (19). The probability of there being an absorption after time</p>
<p>t when there is one incident particle crossing unit area per unit time
is therefore

To obtain the absorption coefficient we must consider the incident
particles not all to have exactly the same energy W“ = E’—H3(°¢°)»
but to have a distribution of energy values about the correct value

particles consisting of one crossing unit area per unit time per unit
energy range, the probability of there being an absorption after time
twill be given by the integral of (5 8)with respect to E '. This integral
may be evaluated in the same wvay as (3 7) of§ 46 and is equal to</p>

<p>206 COLLISION PROBLEMS §53</p>
<p>The connexion between the absorption and emission coefficients
(59) and (56) and the resonance scattering coefficients calculated in
the preceding section should be noted. When the incident beam does
not consist of particles all with the same energy, but consists of a unit
distribution of particles per unit energy range crossing unit area per
unit time, the total number of incident particles with energies near
an absorption line that get scattered will be given by the integral
of (54) with respect to E’. If one neglects the dependence of the
numerator of (54) on E’, this integral will, since</p>
<p>o0 b ’
j (E’—Ek—a)2+b2dE m T’</p>
<p>have just the value (59). Thus the total number J scattered particles
in the neighbourhood of an absorption line is equal to the total number
absorbed. We can therefore regard all these scattered particles as
absorbed particles that are subsequently re-emitted in a different
direction. Further, the number of particles in the neighbourhood of
the absorption line that get scattered per unit solid angle about a
given direction specified by p' and then belong to scatterers in state
a’ will be given by the integral with respect to E’ of (53), which
integral has in the same way the value</p>
<p>élwghzWﬂ/VUP’ w , ,

<p>This is just equal to the absorption coefficient (59) multiplied by the
emission coefficient (56) divided by 2b Hi, the total emission coefficient.
This is in agreement with the point of view of regarding the resonance
scattered particles as those that are absorbed and then re-emitted,
with the absorption and emission processes governed independently
each by its own probability law, since this point of view would
make the fraction of the total number of absorbed particles that are
re-emitted in a unit solid angle about a given direction just the
emission coefficient for this direction divided by the total emission
coefficient.</p>
