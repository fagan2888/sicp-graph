#74. The electromagnetic ﬁeld in the absence of matter

THE theory of radiation that was set up in Chapter X involved some
approximations in its handling of the interaction of the radiation
with matter. The object of the present chapter is to remove these
approximations and get, as far as possible, an accurate theory of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld interacting with matter, subject to the limitation
that the matter consists only of electrons and positrons. Too little is
known about other forms of matter, protons, neutrons, etc., for one
to attempt at the present time to get an accurate theory of their
interaction with the electromagnetic ﬁeld. But there exists a precise
theory of electrons and positrons, as given in the preceding chapter,
which one can use for building up a precise theory of the interaction
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld with this form of matter. The theory
must bring in the interaction of the electrons and positrons with one
another, through their Coulomb forces, as well as their interaction
with electromagnetic radiation, and it must, of course, conform to
special relativity. For brevity in this chapter we shall take c = l.

We must ﬁrst consider the electromagnetic ﬁeld without interaction
with matter. Now in § 63 we set up ﬁrst a treatment of the ﬁeld of
radiation without interaction of matter. Dynamical variables were
there introduced to describe the ﬁeld, commutation relations were
established for them, and a Hamiltonian was found which made them
vary correctly with the time. No approximations were made in this
piece of work. The resulting theory would therefore be a satisfactory,
exact theory of radiation without interaction with matter, were it not
for one feature in it, namely our taking the scalar potential to be zero.
This feature spoils the relativistic form of the theory and makes it
unsuitable as a starting-point from which to develop a precise theory
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in interaction with matter.

We must therefore extend the treatment of $63 by leaving A,
general and bringing it into the work along with the other potentials
A,, A,, A,. Thus we shall have the four A, and they will satisfy, as
the generalization of (62) of § 63,

53A,, = 0, aAp/aw, m o. (l), (B)
For the present we shall ignore the second of these equations.

§74= THE ELECTROJIAGNETIC FIELD 277

For the present we shall ignore the second of these equations and
Work only from the first.

Equation (1) shows that each A, can be resolved into waves
travelling with the velocity of light. Thus, corresponding to equation

(63)  63:  x J‘  eikas+gflk e-ik.x) d316, 

where Ic.x denotes the four-dimensional scalar product
10.x = kQacO-(hx),
k1, being the 4-vector whose space components are the same as the
components of the three-dimensional vector k of $ 6 3 and whose time
component k0 = [k], and d3k denotes dial 62kg dies, as in § 63. The index
c in the coefficients Aflk indicates that they are constant in time. We
shall later introduce some other Fourier coefficients A)“, not constant
in time, which must be distinguished from the present ones.
The Fourier component Afm has a part A3,, coming from A0(:c) and
a part Aﬁk (r = 1, 2, 3) which is a three-dimensional vector. The latter
can be decomposed into two parts, a longitudinal part lying in the
direction of k, the direction of motion of the waves, and a transverse
part perpendicular to k. The longitudinal part is k, IcS/IcJKAQk. The
transverse'part is
(SrsTTkr 155/1502) 3k = ﬂgk» (4)
say. It satisfies krﬂfﬁk = O. (5)

It is known from the Maxwell theory of light that only the trans-
verse part is effective for giving electromagnetic radiation. Chapter X
dealt only with this transverse part, the Am of § 63 being the same as
the present d $1; and equation (6 5)of $ 63 corresponding to the present
equation (5). Nevertheless, the longitudinal part cannot be neglected
in a complete theory of electrodynamics because of its connexion
with the Coulomb forces, as will show up later.

We can now decompose the three-dimensional vector A,.(x) into

two parts, a transverse part and a longitudinal part. The former is
Wm) = f wskeik~w+ﬁskerik~x> 613k

and satisfies 8.sai,(as)/6a:,. = O. (5)

The longitudinal part may be expressed as the gradient 817/805,. of a
scalar V given by

V m i f ks/lc02.(A§keik-°=- A31. 6'15"“) m. ('1')
Thus A, = mﬁav/ax, (s)

273 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS §74=

The magnetic field is determined by the transverse part of A,,
.1?‘ = curlA = curlﬂ.

It is convenient t0 count A0(x) as longitudinal, so that the complete
potentials A,,(x) are separated into a transverse part affix) and a
longitudinal part A,, ﬁV/ﬁx, This separation, of course, refers to a
particular Lorentz frame of reference.and must not be used when one
wants to keep one's equations in a relativistic form.

Each Fourier coefficient Aim occurs in (3) combined with the time
factor eikox». The product

Af»¢@"""”" = Auk (a
say, forms a Hamiltonian dynamical variable in classical mechanics
and a Heisenberg dynamical variable in quantum mechanics, like the
the A,,, of §63.

The work of § 63 gives us the P.B. relations for the transverse part
of A, To connect up with it, we pass over to discrete k-values in
three-dimensional k-space and take, for example, a particular discrete
k-value for which k1 = k2 = 0, k3 = k0 > 0. Then the polarization
variable 1 can take on two values referring to the two directions 1

and 2 and equation (7 3) of § 63 gives, with the help of the commutation
relations for the 17’s and is, equations (ll) of § 60,

[A-IIUJATRI] = [ZﬂuA-Qk] :‘_"7:8k/47T2k0' (10)

The work of § 63 gives us .no information about A3,, and A,,.
However, we can now obtain the P.B. relations for A3,, and A,,
from the theory of relativity. Equations (l()) have to be built up into
a relativistic set and the only simple way of doing so is by adding to

them the two further equations

M3.“ Ask] = aim“ A,,,] = _7;3k/4772k0: (1 1)
so that the four equations (l0) and (l1), together with the conditions

that EM, and A,, commute for p. # v (as they must do since they
refer to different degrees of freedom), combine to form the single

tensor equation [ EH1“ Ark] I 7; gpv 8k f 477216” (12)

We get'in this way the P.B. relations for all,the dynamical variables.
Equation (12) can be extended to

[Z1110 A 11K] Z igpv 8k skkJéqi-gkﬂ‘ (1 

Let us now return to continuous k-values. To convert 3W to con-

§74 THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD 379

tinuous k-values we note that, for a general function f ( k )in three-
dimensional k-space,

grows...» = fun = f /(k)8<k-1<’>d3k, <14)
where S(k—-k') is the three-dimensional 8 function
5(k—k') = 5W1-kl)5tkrké)5(ka—ké)-

In order that (14) may conform to the standard formula connecting
sums and integrals, equation (52) of § 62, we must have

8,5,“, = 5(k-k’). (15)
Thus ( 13) goes over to
[.l'1“,k,.4,,k.] = zgpyétwﬂk, . S(k-~k’). (16)
This equation, together with the equations
[Apl-PAVl-U] T“ [Anpksﬁvkll T: O) 

provide the P.B. relations in the theory with continuous k-values.
It should be noted that these P.B. relations remain valid if we replace

A,,, Auk by Aim, 15k. The same P.B. relations apply to the constant
Fourier coefficients AfLk, 3k.

We must now obtain a Hamiltonian which makes each dynamical
variable A,, vary with the time t = x0 in the Heisenberg picture

according to the law ( 9 )with Aft,‘ constant. Calling this Hamiltonian
HF, we require

[A,,, HF] = dApk/dxo = ikoA”. (18)
It is easily seen that this is satisfied by
HF = -4w2 f k,2.4,,,.I1"~k¢13k. (19)

We therefore take (19), with the possible addition of an arbitrary
numerical term not involving any dynamical variables, as the Hamil-
tonian for the electromagnetic field in the absence of matter.

In § 63 we used our knowledge of the transverse part of the Hamil-
tonian to obtain the P.B.s of the transverse variables. We have now
applied the reverse procedure to the longitudinal variables, using our
knowledge of their P.B.s, obtained by a relativistic argument, to
find the part of the Hamiltonian,that refers to them so as to get
agreement with (18).

If we write out the Hamiltonian (19) it ‘appears as

HF = 4°72 I koglfi1kglk+Aakgjzk+Ask Z31¢'"'A01=-Z0k) d3,‘-

280 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS §74

The first three terms of the integrand here have a transverse part
which is just equal t0 the transverse energy given by (71) of § 63.
The last term of the integrand, which is the part of HF referring t0
the scalar potential A,, appears with a minus sign. This nainus sign
is demanded by relativitv and means that the dynamical system
formed by the variables A,,, Zqk is a harmonzc oscillator cf negative
energy. It is rather surprising that such an unphysical idea as negative
energy should appear in the theory in this way. We shall see in § 77
that the negative energy associated with the degrees of freedom
connected with A, is always compensated by the positive energy
associated with the other longitudinal degrees of freedom, so that
it never shows up in practice.

#75. Relativistic form of the quantum conditions

The theory of the preceding section has relativistic field equations,
namely equations (l). To establish that the theory is fully relativistic
we n1ust show further that the P.B. relations are relativistic. This is
not at all evident from the form (16) in which they are written in
terms of Fourier components. We shall obtain a relativistic form for
the P.B.s by working out [A Mac), A,,(x')] with x and x’ any two points
in space-time. We must first, however, study a certain invariant

singular function that esists in space-time.
The function 8m” as“) is evidently Lorentz invariant. It vanishes

everywhere except on the light-cone with the origin as vertex, i.e. the
three-dimensional space as}, an“ = 0. This light-cone consists of two
distinct parts, afuturepart, for which x0 > 0, and apastp art, for which
x0 < 0. The function which equals 3m“ x12‘) on the future part of the
light-cone and --5(xp as“) on the past part of the light-cone is also
Lorentz invariant. This function, equal to 8w}, x#)x0/|x0|, plays
an important role in the dynamical theory of fields, so we introduce
a special notation for it. We define

2(2) = 25(21,.w“)2@/l20f- <22)
This definition gives a meaning to the function A applied to any
4-vector. With the help of (9) of § 15, we can express 8w” x3) in the

m“ 222.22) = %|X|-1{2<2@- |Xn+2<20+ I20}, <21)

|X| being the length of the three-dimensional part of w”, and then

$75 RELATIVISTIC FORM OF THE QUANTUM CONDITIONS 281

A(cc) is deﬁned to have the value zero at the origin, and evidently
A(--a:) I —--A(x).

Let us make a Fourier analysis of A(:c). Using d4x t0 denote
dxodscldxgdxa and d3x to denote dx,dx2dx3 We have, for any 4-

By introducing polar coordinates |X|, O, g6 in the three-dimensional
x1 x2 x3 space, With the direction of the three-dimensional part of 7a,,
as pole, We get

Thus the Fourier analysis gives the same function again, with the
coefficient 411-22’. Interchanging k and x in (23), We get

Aw) x “@4172. f A(Ic)e"”°-"= m. (24)

Some of the important properties of A(x) can easily be deduced
from its Fourier resolution. In the first place equation (24) shows that
A(a:) can be resolved into Waves all travelling with the velocity of
light. To get an equation for this result We apply the operator III to
both sides of (24), thus

Baa) = --i/41r2. f A(ic)[]eik-“ (1% = i/41r2. f t, kHA(k)e““-“=d4k.
Now k“ kPA(k).= O, and hence

This equation holds throughout space-time. We can give a meaning

and transforming it t0 a three-dimensional surface integral by Gauss's
theorem. Equation (25)informs us that the three-dimensional surface
integral always vanishes.

The function A(a:) vanishes all over the three-dimensional surface
x0 = 0. Let us determine the value of 8A(x)/6x0 on this surface. It
evidently vanishes everywhere except at the point x1 r: x2 = x3 = 0,
where it has a singularity which can be evaluated as follows. Differ-
entiating both sides of (24) with respect to mo, we get

8A(x)/8x0 = 1/4112. f IcOA(k)e'*5“-“ d41<

Putting x0 = 0 on both sides here, we get.

Thus the ordinary 8 singularity, with the coefficient 411-, appears at
the point x, = :02 = x3 == 0.

Let us now evaluate [A,,(a:), A,,(x’)]. We have from (3), (16), and (17)

The k0 here; is defined to be equal to |k| and is thus always positive.
By putting -k for k in the second part of the integrand, one finds
that (27)is equal to the four-dimensional integral

in which k0 takes on all values, negative as well as positive. Evaluating
this with the help of (24), we get finally

§75 RELATIVISTIC FORM OF THE QUANTUM CONDITIONS 283

a result Which shows that the P.B. relations are invariant under
Lorentz transformations.

The formula (28) means that the potentials at two points in space-
time always commute unless the line joining the two points is a null
line, i.e. the track of a light-ray. The formula is consistent with the
ﬁeld equations IIIAPM) = 0, because |:| applied to the right-hand
side gives zero, from (25).

#76. The dynamical variables at one time

As a basis for a theory with interaction we must use the dynamical
variables at one time. The relationships between the dynamical
variables at one time (Le. their P.B.s) are not affected by the introduc-
tion of interaction. On the other hand the relationships between the
dynamical variables at different times (comprising the field equations
as well as the PQBfs" of variables at different times) are very much
affected by the interaction. The dynamical variables at one time form
a non-relativistic concept, but a very important concept in Hamil-
tonian theory.

For the case of the electromagnetic field the independent dynamical
variables at one time are A, and aAp/ﬁaso for all values of x1, x,, x3 for
the given x0. The higher time derivatives 62AP/8x02,..., are not
independent. Let us put

B’, T. 9i». (29)
8x0
Then we have A,,, Bpx, with the suffix X denoting 2:1, x2, x3, as the
dynamical variables at one time.
The Fourier resolution of these variables is, from (3)and (9),

We may reverse the Fourier transformation and express Aug-JIM,
amnd A Plf-"A W}, in terms of A, and B)“ respectively. Thus A,,,, and
A,,,, are determined by LA, B,“ for all x (at a given x,). The equa-
tions connecting A,,,, A,,,, with A, Bpx do not involve the time
explicitly. Thus the A, A,,,‘ form an alternative set of one-time
dynamical variables, on the same footing as the A, B,

When we work with the variables A,,, BM, we shall need to know

(39)

284 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS §76

their P.B. relations. These may be obtained either from the Fourier
expansions (3 0) together with (16) and (1 7) or from the general P.B.
relation (28). The latter gives the required results more quickly.
Putting xf, = x0 in (28), we get

[A A,,] = o. (s1)

P-X’

Differentiating (2 8) with respect to x0 and then putting m}, = mo, we
get, with the help of (26),

[Bpxv A106] z 47rgpvs(xwx')' 
Differentiating (2 8) with respect to both x0 and x1, and then putting
w; = mo, W6 g“ [BM BM] = 0, (as)

since 82A(x)/8x§ = 0 for x0 = 0. Equations (31), (32), and (33) give
all the P.B. relations between the A,,, B, variables. They show that,
apart from numerical coefficients, the A,, can be looked upon as a set
of dynamical coordinates and the B,“ as their conjugate momenta,
there being a 5 function on the right-hand side of (32) instead of a
two-suffix 3 symbol on account of the number of degrees of freedom
being a continuous infinity.

We can decompose A, into a transverse and a longitudinal part,
as shown by equations ( 8 )and (6). We can do the same with B”, and
get

 

6U
B = $,+_ (34)

From ( 7 )with —k substituted fork in the second term of the inte grand,

The corresponding equation for U is, since U = EV/ﬁxo,

The electric field is given by

Thus dive‘ = QgBr-vaa,

It is evident that any longitudinal variable commutes with any

transverse variable. Some useful P.B. relations Will now be Worked
out. We shall use the notation— for any ﬁeld function fx,

Si:   w
If in (-32)We put ‘p = w‘, v = s and differentiate the equation with
respect to 22,, We get
[BrxyuA-ﬁrxil r" 47Tgrssr(x—x’) = “47TSS(X“"X’)>
or, from (39), [div expr] = 41r58(x-~x'). (41)
Now (39) shows that div8 is a function only of the longitudinal
variables, so (41) gives
[div 6x, KKK] = 4w88(x—x ’) = —4w3~‘-*'(x—xQ.
Integrating With respect to avg, We get
[div @X,VX, = —41r8(X—-X'), (42)
there being no constant of integration since the field functions éx and
V; are made up of Waves of non-zero Wave length. From (4 2)and (39)
V‘3[Ux,T/1,] = 4118(x— x’).
Integrating With the help of formula (72) of § 38, We get
[Uxr-Vzﬂ] = —|X—X'|-1, <43)
there being no constant of integration or other terms not vanishing

at infinity on the right-hand side, because U,‘ and V; are made up of
Waves of non-zero Wave length. We have from (3 8)and (43)

[ErmVJE] = -[U" VJ = —(»"v1~—wZ-)IX—X'I'B~ <44)

We shall now obtain the Hamiltonian in terms of the A,, and B,,

286 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS §76
Adding and dividing by —8w, we get
-.(s-.¢)-1 f (B, BH-i-AFTAP’) 033x
= -2».¢2 f k02(,4,kZ»k+,=I,,_k Atgk) @1316.

This is equalto HF given by (19), apart from an inﬁnite numerical
term. The formula (19)for HF already involves an arbitrary numerical
term, so we may take

HF = —(81r)"”1 I (B, BP-i-AMYAP’) daze: (45)

with an arbitrary numerical term, diﬁerent from that of (I9).

The Hamiltonian (4 5)can, of course, be used to give the Heisenberg
equations of motion, and the arbitrary numerical term in it does not
have any effect. One can easily check, using (31), (3 2)and (33), that

GAP/Elmo = [AWHF] = B“, } (46)
and aBH/awo = [B,, HF] = V214”,
agreeing with (2 9) and (1). It also gives the Schrodinger equation of
mot“ Qrﬁduw/dwo = Flp)

for a ket |P) representing a state in the Schrodinger picture. The
arbitrary numerical term here has the effect of changing 1P) by a
phase factor, which is not of physical importance.

We can decompose the expression (45) for HF- into a transverse
part HFT and a longitudinal part HFL. We have from (3 4)

f 3,3,. 613w = f (.@,+ U')(.@,+ (7') 43$
‘JL’ f .@,.@, (i325 +  U"U"d3x,
since the cross terms vanish on account of

from (3 5). Similarly we have from (8)
J AQA,” d3x = I aifﬂaﬁ.” dam + f VwV” d3x,
with the cross terms vanishing again. Thus (4 5) becomes
HF = HFT-l-HFL,
with Hm. = (am-l f (.@,.e2,+.@4.8.@¢) d3x (4?)
and Hm = (87r)"'1 f (U'U'+V"8V"--B0BO-Aonéo’) 0532:. ‘ (48)

§75 THE SCHRQDINGER DYNAMICAL VARIABLES 287
It should be noted that the term

so this term is just the magnetic energy. Some further partial inte-
grations give
j VrsVa-s dsx = I VrrVss dsx’

so (48) may be written

Ha. = car‘ I {(U'_A0)r(U+AO)T+(VW-_BO)(VS8+BO)}dax‘ (w)

#77. The supplementary conditions

We must now go back to the Maxwell equation (2), which we have
ignored so far. We cannot take this equation over directly into the
quantum theory without getting inconsistencies. The left-hand side
of the equation does not commute with A,,(x’), according to the
quantum conditions (28), so this left-hand side cannot vanish. The
way out of the difficulty was shown by Fermitf It consists in adopting
a less stringent equation, namely the equation

(8AP/8xp)|P> = 0, (50)
and assuming it to hold for any [P) corresponding to a state that can
actually occur in nature. There is one equation (50) for each point
in space-time and these equations must all hold for any ket corre-
sponding to a state that can actually occur.

We shall call a condition such as (50), which a ket has to satisfy to
correspond to an actual state, a supplementary condition. The exis-
tence of supplementary conditions in the theory does not mean any
departure from or modification in the general principles of quantum
mechanics. The principle of superposition of states and the whole of
the general theory of states, dynamical variables, and observables,
as given in Chapter II, apply also when there are supplementary

1' Fermi, Reviews d Modern Physics, 4 (1932), 125.

28s QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS §77

conditions, provided we impose a further requirement on a linear
operator in order that it may represent an observable. We deﬁne a
linear operator to be physical if it has the property that, when it
operates on any ket satisfying the supplementary conditions, it pro-
duces another ket satisfying the supplementary conditions. In order
that a linear operator may represent an observable it must evidently
satisfy the requirement of being physical, in addition to the require-
ments of § l0.

We have already had an example of supplementary conditions in
the theory of systems containing several similar particles. The con-
dition that only symmetrical wave functions, or only antisymmetrical
wave functions, represent states that can actually occur in nature, is
precisely of the same type as condition (50) and is what we are now
calling a supplementary condition. In this theory the requirement
that a linear operator shall be physical is that it shall be symmetrical
between the similar particles.

When we introduce supplementary conditions into our theory we
must verify that they are consistent, i.e. not too restrictive to allow
any ket at all to satisfy them. If we have more than one supplementary
condition, we can deduce further supplementary conditions from them
by taking P.B.s of the operators in them; thus if we have

U|P> = 0, V|P> = 0, (51)

we can deduce
W, Vl|P> = 9, [U15], VHIP) = 0, (52)

and so on. To verify that our supplementary conditions are consistent
we have to look into all the further supplementary conditions obtain-
able by this procedure to see that they can be satisfied, which we can
usually do by showing that after a certain point the further supple-
mentary conditions are all either identically ,satisfied or repetitions
of the previous ones.

We must also verify that the supplementary conditions are in agree-
ment with the equations of motion. In the Heisenberg picture, for
which the ket (P) in (51 )is fixed, we shall have different supplementary
conditions referring to differenttimes and they must all be consistent,
in the way discussed above. In the Schrodinger picture, for which the
ket |P) varieswith the time inaccordance with Schrodinger ’S equation,
we require that if |P) satisfies the supplementary conditions initially
it satisfies them always. This'means that d|P>/dt must satisfy the

§77 THE SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS 289

supplementary conditions, or that H {P} must satisfy the supplemen-
tary conditions, or that H must be physical.
It is convenient When We have a supplementary condition UIP) = 0

‘[0 Write U g 0 (53)

and to call (53 ) a Weak equation, in distinction to an ordinary or strong
equation. A Weak equation gives another Weak equation if it is
multiplied by any factor on the left, but does not in general give a valid
equation if it is multiplied by a factor on the right. Thus a Weak
equation must not be used in Working out P.B.s. With this Way of
speaking, the requirement (52) that the supplementary conditions are
consistent becomes the requirement that the P.B.s of the operators
in the supplementary conditions shall vanish Weakly.

The condition for a dynamical variable £1 to be physical is that, for
each supplementary condition UIP) = O, We have

UEIP) = 0,
and hence [U , 5]] P) = O.

Thus the condition is that the P.B. of the dynamical variable With
each of the operators of the supplementary conditions shall vanish

Weakly.
Let us noW return to electrodynamics. We take equation (2) to be

a Weak equation, so it should be Written

EJAM/élxp F5 . (54) g
In the Heisenberg picture We have one of these equations for each
point x. To check their consistency, We take tWo arbitrary points x
and a2’ in space-time and form the P.B.

Evaluating it With the help of (28), We get

from (25), so the requirements for consistency are satisﬁed strongly.
As We have veriﬁed that the supplementary conditions are consistent
at all times in the Heisenberg picture, We have veriﬁed that they are
in agreement With the equations of motion.

Since equation (54) is only a Weak equation, any of its consequences

290 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS §77

in the ordinary Maxwell theory will be valid in the quantum theory
only as weak equations. The equations

div}! = 0, Elf/ﬁt = --curl 6

follow simply from the deﬁnitions of € and}?! in terms of the potentials,
so they are valid strongly in the quantum theory. The other Maxwell
equations for empty space, namely

div é‘ ﬁ 0, Bé/ﬁt z curllf, (55)

are weak equations in the quantum theory, because one needs the
help of (54) as well as (1) in deriving them.

The ﬁeld quantities é andﬂ are components of the antisymmetric
tensor 8A"/8a:H-6AP/6x,. The P.B. of the tensor with the operator
of (54) at a general point x’ is

It follows that é‘ and J?‘ are physical. The potentials A“ are not
physical.

The supplementary conditions affecting the dynamical variables at
a particular time are

aAe ~ 0 3- iﬁe g5 0. (56)

55,, T’ ’ 8x0 6x“

Higher differentiations with respect to x0 do not give independent
equations, but equations which are consequences of these and the
strong equation (1). Thus in terms of the Schrodinger variables of
§ 76, the supplementary conditions are

B,+A,f m 0 (57)
and (AJ-l-BJ i=5 O. (58)

Equation (5 8)is the same as the ﬁrst of equations (55)and may also

be written, from (39),
V2(A0+ U) m 0.

Since this holds throughout three-dimensional space, it leads to

A0+U ‘:5 0. (59)
Noting that A,’ = V”, we can now see from (49) that
HF, e 0. <60)

Thus there is n0 longitudinal ﬁeld etaergy for states that 00cm" in nature.

§77 THE SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS 291

To set up a convenient representation, we introduce a standard ket
10F) satisfying the supplementary conditions

(Bo-1—A,.”)|0F) = 0, (AU-l- U)|OF> = 0, (61)
and also satisfying EIQOF) = 0. (52)

These conditions are consistent, because i}, commutes with the
operators in (61), and they are sufficient to ﬁx 10F) completely, apart
from a numerical factor, because the only independent dynamical
variables that we have are A,, B0, U, A,', .1241‘, it‘, and of these
AO-l- U, Bo-l-Af, 54k form a complete commuting set. With this
standard ket we can express any ket as

‘PTAQ, Bu» Mm) I951) (63)

Our representation is just the Fock representation so far as concerns
the transverse dynamical variables HQ‘, 5;,“ so ‘P’ must be a power
series in the variables Mk, with different terms in the series corre-
sponding to the presence of different numbers of photons. The number
of variables occurring in ‘P’ is a continuous infinity, so ‘l’ is what
mathematicians call a ‘functional’.

If the ket (63) satisfies the supplementary conditions, ‘F must be
independent of A, and B0, and thus a function only of the Mm. So
physical states are represented by kets of the form

‘PT-ﬁﬁk) i0F>> (54)

with ‘F a power series in the variables Mk. The standard ket 10F)
itself represents the physical state with no photons present, the perfect
vacuum.

Our Hamiltonian HF and its parts HFL, HFT have so far contained
arbitrary numerical terms. It is convenient to choose these terlns so
that HF , HFT are zero for the perfect vacuum. The result (60) shows
that HFL given by (48) or (49) has the numerical term in it correctly
chosen to make HFL have the value zero for the perfect vacuum, as
well as for every other physical state. We must take HFT to be

the transverse part of (19), in order that the numerical term in it may
be correctly chosen to give no Zero-point energy for the photons.
(47) differs from (65) by an inﬁnite numerical term, consisting of a
half-quantum of energy for each photon state.

#78. Electrons and positrons by themselves

We now consider electrons and positrons in the absence of electro-
magnetic ﬁeld. The state of an electron is described, as in Chapter XI,
by a wave function 5b with four components ab‘, (a= 1, 2, 3, 4), satis-
fying the wave equation

13?; g”; z mm cxrg-i-r-kammyb. - (66)
To get a many-electron theory we shall apply the method of second
quantization of § 65, which involves changing the one-electron wave
function into a set of operators satisfying certain anticommutation
relations.

When we are dealing with 5b at various places at a given time we
may write it 3b,‘, with X denoting x,, x2, x3. Its components are then
ybux. We pass to the momentum representation with the wave function
9b,, by a three-dimensional Fourier resolution

5px I he f eﬂXlﬂ/ﬁlﬁp d3 , ¢p = he J‘ e-s<xp>ln¢x d393, (67)

3b,, has four components gbap, corresponding to the four components
of 5b,‘. In this representation the energy operator is

1b Z arpr+05n1mv

in which the momentum operators p, are multiplying factors.
We can separate 5b into a positive-energy part 5 and a negative-

energy part Q, 5h z 5+‘;

f and § each having four components like 5b. In the momentum
representation they are given by

1 o: Q9 +0: ‘m

and similarly 15g!) = _(p2-|-m2)*§p,
showing that 5p and {p are eigenfunctions of p0 with the eigenvalues
(p2+m2) * and — (p2+m2) *respectively. When one is working with

one should note that their squares are equal t0 themselves and their
product in either order is zero.

The second quantization makes the We into operators like the ifs
of § 65, satisfying anticommutation relations like (ll') of § 65. Using
the notation for the anticommutator

According to the interpretation of § 65, the operators qbap are
operators of annihilation of an electron of momentum p and the
operators Jap are operators of creation of an electron of momentum p.
To avoid the unphysical notion of negative-energy electrons, We must
pass over to a new interpretation based on the positron theory of § 73.
The annihilation of a negative-energy electron is to be understood as
the creation of a hole in the sea of negative-energy electrons, or the
creation of a positron. So the operators ﬁap become operators of
creation of a positron. The positron has the momentum — p, because
an amount p of momentum gets annihilated. Similarly the Zap become
operators of annihilation of a positron of momentum --p. The 5,,
and ﬁap are operators of annihilation and creation respectively of an
ordinary, positive-energy electron of momentum p.

294 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS §78

It should be noted that, although 5p has four components, only
two of them are independent, because the four are connected by

1_  5 2 0
(P2+m2)* p ’
which involves two independent equations. The two independent
components of £1, ‘correspond to the annihilation of an electron in
each of the two independent states of spin. Similarly Q1, has only
two independent components, because of the equations

and they correspond to the creation of a positron in the two inde-
pendent states of spin.

The vacuum state, for which there are no electrons or positrons

present, is represented by the ket |0P) satisfying

fapl0p> -'"= 9» Zﬂplop) E 0- (74)
We can use this ket as the standard ket of a representation. We then
have any ket expressed as

Lldwgapa Cap) IOP):

in which the function, or rather functional, ‘P’ is a power series in the
variables 5a,, Zap. Each term of ‘I’ is like (l7') of§ 65. It must not
contain any of its variables to a higher power than'the first. It corre-
sponds to the existence of certain (positive-energy) electrons and
certain positrons, in states specified by the labels of the variables
appearing ‘in it.

From (l2') of § 65, the total number of electrons is flap 1b,‘, d3p
summed over a. We may write it in the notation of equation (12) of
§ 67 as f 5F}, 1/1,, d3p. Transforming it to the X-representation by (67),

we get
h-s ‘UT e-i(ifv)lne-wl(x'p-)la ‘ﬁx, dsxGpxIda x f  lbx dam,
showing that the density of the electrons is  glrx. This result includes
an infinite constant representing the density of the sea of negative-
energy electrons.

We get a quantity of more physical significance if we take the total

charge Q, equal to the number of positive-energy electrons minus the
number of holes or positrons, all multiplied by —e. Thus

Q = -@ f (égigg-ztip) dsp- <15)

§78 ELECTRONS AND POSITRONS BY THEMSELVES 295

We can evaluate this with the help of (68). Using the transpose of

a result which We may assume- still holds for p' = p. Then the
expression for Q reduces to

Q = -@ j %(LZ‘-L¢p-T¢I)$p) (1311
Transforming it to the X-representation as before, We get
Q = --e f %@i¢x“¢ilzx) m,
showing that the charge density is

The interpretation of the one-electron Wave function in § 68 gives,
besides the probability density 92w, a probability current Jlarqb.
With second quantization We shall have correspondingly a ﬂow of
electrons, given by the operator  0a,. 50x. The sea of negative-energy
electrons produces no resultant ﬂow of electrons, from symmetry,
and'so the electric current is

The total energy of the electrons is, from formula (29)of§ 60, which
is valid also for fermions,

This total energy contains an infinite numerical term representing
the energy of the sea of negative-energy electrons.
We get a quantity of more physical signiﬁcance if We take the energy

of all the electrons and positrons, reckoning the energy of the vacuum
as zero. This quantity is

From (76), the ﬁrst integral in (82) is the same as (79) and is just
H)». The second integral is an inﬁnite constant and is minus the
energy of all the negative-energy electrons of the vacuum distribution.

We may take either H P or HP» as the Hamiltonian. The Heisenberg
equation of motion for nﬁax is thus

a¢axfax0 z [Qbaxr HP] x [hhlxigly]!

and if we work this out we just get back to the wave equation for 1L,
namely (66).

We must now look into the question of whether the theory is
relativistic. It is built up from operators 5b which satisfy the ﬁeld

equations (66). These equations are the same as the wave equation
for the one-electron wave function and are known to be invariant

under Lorentz transformations, provided 1,1: transforms according to
the law (20) of Chapter XI. Our present theory goes beyond the
one-electron theory in that anticommutation relations are introduced
for the We and rFs, and it becomes necessary to verify that these
anticommutation relations are Lorentz invariant.

We proceed by a method analogous to that of $75. We take two
general points X and X’ in space-time and form the anticommutator

Kabﬂlaw’) = ¢a(%)$b(w')+s5b(x')¢a(w)- (83)

We can evaluate it by working directly from the anticommutation
relations (7l)for the Fourier components of 1,1: and  A simpler way
is to note certain properties that Kab(x,x') must have, namely

(i) it involves w“ and w; only through their difference xF-azl;

§78 ELECTRONS AND POSITRONS BY THEMSELVES 297

(ii) it satisﬁes the wave equation

on account of (Mat) satisfying (66);
(iii) for x0 = x}, it has the value 8ab8(x-—x'), as follows from the

third of equations (70).

These properties are sufficientto ﬁx Kab(x, x’) completely, since (iii)
ﬁxes it for x0 = x5, (ii) shows how it depends on x0, and (i)then shows
how it depends on  The solution is easily seen to be

where the Z means a summation over the two values j; (p2+m2)* for
p0 with particular values forp, , p2, pa. It satisﬁes (ii)since the operator

in (84) produces the factor (po-ocrpr-ocmm) in the integrand of
(85), which factor gives zero when multiplied on the left into the

factor {  It satisfies (iii) since, with x0 = x1), the summation over p0

makes the second term in  cancel out.
The law of transformation for 1,1’ and l}; given in § 68 has the effect

of making the quantities $l(:t3')ozp1,b__(w) transform like the four com-

ponents of a 4-vector and making ¢l(X')<1m:/1(a:) invariant. Thus
l~¢‘*(w’>a,.¢<w>+si*<x'>am mm) <86)

is invariant with l!‘ any 4-vector and S any scalar. The invariance

of (86) must be sufficient to ensure the correct transformationlaw
for 9b and Q since it enables one to deduce the invariance of thk Wave

equation for 1,0, by taking Z1“ = M’, a/ﬁxp, S = —m.
The invariance of (86) leads to the invariance of

#79. The interaction

The complete Hamiltonian for electrons and positrons interacting
with the electromagnetic ﬁeld is

where HF is the Hamiltonian for the electromagnetic ﬁeld alone,

given by (19) or (45), HP is the Hamiltonian for the electrons and

positrons alone, given by (8 0)or (81), and HQ is the interaction energy,
involving the dynamical variables of the electrons and positrons as
well as those of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. We take

HQ = f AP), d302, (90)

withj}, given by (7 7 )and (78), as we shall see that this gives the correct
equations of motion. Thus, with neglect of inﬁnite numerical terms,

H = f {-.F*@.<~Hv1¢r-@A'¢>+J*Qmm¢-%@A"<J*¢~¢W>} 613w —
-—-—(8'.=T)"'1 f (B, Bu-Apgpliwqdaw. (91)

Let us work out the Heisenberg equations of motion that follow
from the Hamiltonian (91). We have

 85bux/ax0 x labax H-“Hlwbax z 5bax(HP+HQ)_ (HPTl-Hqgyrhax

Thus {alpha-gi- +614”) 4a,, m}:,b £0. (92)

This agrees with the one-electron wave equation (1 1) of Chapter XI.
Since H is real, the equation of motion for 1Z1 will be the conjugate of
the equation of motion for qé and so will agree with (12)of Chapter XI.
Thus the interaction (9 0) gives correctly the action of the ﬁeld on the
electrons and positrons. Further we have, making use of the P.B.
relations in (46),

(93)and (94) lead to 11A,. = 4W9)“ (95)

which agrees with the Maxwell theory and shows that the interaction
(90) gives correctly the action of the electrons and positrons on the
ﬁeld.

To complete the theory we must bring in the Supplemental‘)? con-
ditions (54). We must verify that they are in agreement with the
equations of motion. The method used in § 77, which consisted in
showing that the supplementary conditions at different times in the
Heisenberg picture are consistent with one another, is no longer
applicable, because the quantum conditions connecting dynamical
variables at different times get altered by the interaction in n. way
that is too complicated to be worked out. So we shall obtain all the
supplementary conditions affecting the dynamical variables zit one
instant of time and check whether they are consistent.

We have again equations (56). A further differentiation with respect

to x0 gives Sewn/exp w o. (95)
Now the equation of motion for (b, namely (92), leads, as in § 68, to

3051.0‘); ‘T: O’
This is the same as éijp/ﬁxp = 0, (97)

because the difference between —-ez,Zl¢ and jg is constant in time, even
though it is infinite. From (95)we now see that (96) holds as a strong
equation. Thus equations (56) are the only independent supplemen-
tary conditions affecting the dynamical variables at one instant of
time. The first of them gives (57), as before, and the second now gives,
with the help of (95)for p. = 0,

(A0"-|-B,)"+4wj0 m’ 0. (98)
This may be written

(Ao-I- U)”—|—4rrjo L’ 0 (99)
or, from (39), div é‘—-4wj0 ",5 O, (100)

and is just one of the Maxwell equations.

300 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS §79

One can see without detailed calculation that, for any two points

X and X’ at the same time,
[jﬂxijﬂxai = 0:

since, from the form of (70), the P.B. must be a multiple of 8(x—-x’)
and cannot contain derivatives of 8(x--x’), while also it has t0 be anti-
symmetrical between X and X’. Thus the eXtra terms 41:35,, in equa-
tions (98)for various values of X, as compared with the corresponding
equations (58), commute with one another as well as with all the
other dynamical variables occurring in (58) and (57). It follows that
these eXtra terms will not disturb the consistency of (58) and (57),
and hence (98) and (57) are consistent.

Our method of introducing interaction into the theory was not
relativistic, since the interaction energy (90)involves the dynamical
variables at an instant of time in some Lorentz frame. It therefore
becomes questionable whether the theory with interaction is a rela-
tivistic one. Our field equations, namely (92) and (95), are evidently
relativistic and so are the supplementary conditions (54). It remains
uncertain whether the quantum conditions are Lorentz invariant.

We know the quantum conditions connecting all our dynamical
variables A px, BPX, (Lax, 1,5,“ at a given time x0. We cannot, as men-
tioned above, work out the general quantum conditions connecting
dynamical variables at any two points in space-time, because the
interaction makes it too complicated. We shall therefore make an
infinitesimal Lorentz transformation and work out the quantum con-
ditions at a given tiine in the new frame of reference. If we can estab-
lish that the quantum conditions are invariant under infinitesimal
Lorentz transformations, their invariance under finite Lorentz trans-
formations will follow.

Let w: be the time coordinate in the new frame of reference. It is
connected with the original coordinates by

x3‘ = wo-l-et/yag, (101)
where e‘ is an infinitesimal number and v, is a three-dimensional vector,
w, being the relative velocity of the two frames. We shall neglect
terms of order e2.

A field quantity K at the place X at the time 021*,‘ in the new frame
has the value
»<(x,x§) = :<(x,a:o)+(x§,“—-a:0)8i<x/6x0 = x(x,xo)+ev,_ x,.[:<x,I-II_

[KXJXJ or anticommutator [Kw Ax"]+) as the case may be, is a number,
and so the last term in (103) or (lO4)vanishes. We are left with

where [KJ]: denotes the P.B. or the anticommutator, as the case may
be. From the form (90) for HQ we see that [hxa HQ] can involve only
the dynamical variables A,,,, 550x’, 1,6,“, and cannot involve any deriva-
tives of these variables. It follows that {Kw [Aw HQ]? if it does not
vanish, will be a multiple of 8(X—-X’) and will not contain terms with
derivatives of 5(X--X'). Hence the last term of (105) vanishes. We
can conclude that [»<(X,xj'§),/\(x’,x§)]i has the same value as when
there is no interaction, and is thus Lorentz invariant from our earlier
work.

A possible criticism of the above proof-should be noted. At several
places we worked out expressions in powers of e and neglected e2.
Such a procedure cannot be valid for calculating [K($),)\(x')]i with X
and X‘ two general points in space-time lying close together, so that
avg-x; is of order s, because the result of the calculation should be
a function of the (xPHxLYS having a singularity when the 4-vector
X-x‘ lies on the light-cone and such a function, of course, cannot be
expanded as a power series in the (xpwxkfs.

302 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS §79

To validate the argument we should reformulate it so as to avoid
the use of the 8 function. Instead of evaluating [:<(x,x§),)l(x’,x§)]i,
we should evaluate

[fax :<(X, mg‘) d350, I ZJXJQX’, x3‘) d3x'L, (106)

Where ax and bx are two arbitrary continuous functions of x,, x2, x3.
Then the quantities that we need to expand in powers of e all vary
continuously with a continuous change in the direction of the time»
axis, and the expansions are justifiable. The equations that we now
get are those of the previous argument multiplied by ax bx, d3xd3x’
and integrated. We are led to the same conclusion—that the P.B.
or anticommutator has the same value as when there is no interaction.
It will be seen that the reason why the interaction does not disturb
the quantum conditions is because it is so simple, involving only the
basic dynamical variables and not their derivatives. The P.B.s and
anticommutators have the same values as with no interaction pro-
vided they refer to variables at two points in space-time that are at
the same time with respect to some observer. This means the two
points must be outside each other's light-cones and may approach
coincidence only along a path lying outside the light-cone.

#80. The physical variables

A ket IP) that represents a physical state must satisfy thk supple-
mentary conditions

(B0-|-A,")|P> = o, (div é‘--4wj0)]P> = 0. (107)
A dynamical variable is physical if, when multiplied into any ket

satisfying these conditions, it gives another ket satisfying these con-
ditions. This requires that it shall commute with the quantities

B,+A,r, div <§-471j0. (108)

Let us see what simple dynamical variables have this property.

The transverse field variables $14,, ﬁ, evidently commute with the
quantities (108) and are physical. The variable 1p“ commutes with
the first of the quantities (108) but not the second and is thus not
physical. We have

iﬁ[‘1bax>‘rL-bx"¢bx'] W‘; (‘ﬂax Lpbx'+$bx'¢ax)¢bx'

$3} is physical. The variables .21., $1., tpfj, 55f; are the only independent
physical variables, apart from the quantities (108) themselves.

We have

i. = ~16<$=61¢=6-~¢1=61J=1>. .11.: 6~@»1'*16111*~ (111)
Thus the charge density and current are physical. Also it is easily
seen that é and l?‘ are physical, just as in the case When there are
no electrons and positrons present. All those variables are physical
that are unaffected by the arbitrariness that exists in the electro-
magnetic potentials in the Maxwell theory.
The operator gbax represents the creation of a positron or the
annihilation of an electron at the place x. Let us see What is the
physical signiﬁcance of the operator gbﬁx. From (4 4)

so for the state ghiﬂp), 6,. at the point x' certainly has the value
c,.+e(x§.-—x,.)[X’-—-X|"3.

This means that the operator gbﬁx, besides creating a positron or annihi-
lating an electron at the point x, increases the electric ﬁeld at the
point x’ by e(:c;—~x,.)|x’-~x["3, Which is just the classical Coulomb
ﬁeld at x' of a positron With charge e at the point x. Thus the operator
gbﬁx creates a positron at the point x together with/its Ooztlomb ﬁeld,

or else annihilates an electron at x together with its Coulomb ﬁeld.

ﬁeld it is the variables $*, F‘, rather than the variables 5b, i, that
correspond t0 the physical processes of creation and annihilation of
electrons and positrons, since these processes must always be accom-
panied by the appropriate Coulomb change in the electric ﬁeld around
the point where the particle is created or annihilated. It is easily seen
that the variables 1/111}, 1,51‘, satisfy the same anticommutation relations

(70) as the unstarred variables. When we pass to the momentum

variables 1,6,, deﬁned by (67), but the physical variables 1,01‘; deﬁned by

‘i: = he f ei<xp>m¢r d3 , a = H f e-isﬁplw: m. (113)

and take 5;‘ to represent the annihilation of an electron of momentum

We may use H* instead of H as our Hamiltonian. It leads t0 me
same Schrodinger equation for a physical ket, since if |P) is physical

H HP) = H |P).
Also it leads to the same Heisenberg equations of motion for physical
variables, since if E is a physical variable

[arm w £5.11)»
Thus H * and H are equivalent Hamiltonians for the physical quanti-
ties, and the others do not matter.

H* involves only physical variables. The longitudinal ﬁeld variables
do not appear in it. Instead of them We have the last term of (114),
Which is just the Coulomb interaction energy of any charges that are
present. The appearance of such a term in a relativistic theory is
rather strange, as it is an energy associated With the instantaneous
propagation of forces. It appears as a result of our having transformed
the theory a long Way from the Heisenberg form in Which the relati-
vistic invariance of the theory is manifest.

We could set up a representation by taking as standard ket the
product of the standard ket |OF> for the electromagnetic ﬁeld alone,
given by (61) and (62), with the standard ket 10p) for the electrons
and positrons alone, given by (74). This representation Would not be
a convenient one, however, because its standard ket does not satisfy
the second of the supplementary conditions (107).

We get a more convenient representation if We take another stan-
dard ket 1Q) satisfying

(BO-I-Af) IQ) = 0, (div<§—-41rj0)§Q) = 0, (115)

 Z O: zzkpiQ> z 0:  Z  

These conditions are consistent, because the operators on |Q> in
them all commute or anticommute With each other, and there are
enough of them to fix IQ) completely, apart from a numerical factor,

306 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS § 80

because there are as many of them as of the conditions for IOFHOP).
The conditions (115) show that |Q) satisﬁes the supplementary con-
ditions and so represents a physical state. The conditions (1 16) show
that IQ) represents a state for wlrich there are no photons, electrons,
or positrons present.

Any ket IP) that satisﬁes the supplementary conditions (107) and
so represents a physical state can be expressed as some physical
variable multiplied into IQ). The only independent physical vari-

ables that give non-vanishing results when applied to |Q> are Mm
.1‘ * . Hence -

‘w’ “P IP) == ‘F0941, 2-1» ZPHQ) (117)
Thus IP) is represented by a wave functional ‘T’ involving the variables
ix, lip, jfp. It is a power series in these variables, the various terms
in it corresponding to the existence of various numbers of photons,
electrons, and positrons, with the Coulomb ﬁelds around the electrons
and positrons.

In using the representation (1 1 7) together with the Hamiltonian H *,

we have a form of the theory in which we can ignore the conditions.

(115), asﬁohey have no effect on the kets (117). We must retain the
conditions (116). The longitudinal variables then no longer appear
in the theory.

#81. Interpretation

The foregoing work establishes the basic equations of quantum
electrodynamics. There are two forms of the theory, involving the
Hamiltonians H and H * respectively. We must now.consider the
interpretation and application of the theory. We shall take the H *
form for deﬁniteness. The argument would be essentially the same
with the H form.

The ket IQ) represents a state for which there are no photons,
electrons, or positrons present. One would be inclined to suppose this
state to be the perfect vacuum, but it cannot be, because it is not
stationary. For it to be stationary we should need to have

H*IQ> = CIQ>

with C a number. Now H* contains the terms

"el \5*l@<~@"¢* dawqhill  dawdgwa (118)

lX"-X’\

which do not give numerical factors when applied to |Q> and which
therefore spoil the stationary character of 1Q).

§81 DIFFICULTIES OF THE THEORY 307

Let us call the state Q represented by 1Q) the no-particle state at
a certain time. If we start with the no-particle state it does not remain
the no-particle state. Particles get created where none previously
existed, their energy coming from the interaction part of the Hamil-

tonian.
T0 study this spontaneous creation of particles, we take the ket

IQ) as initial ket in the Schrodinger picture and treat the terms (118)
as a perturbation giving rise to a probability of the state Q jumping
into another state, in accordance with the theory of § 44. The ﬁrst of
them, resolved into its Fourier components, contains a part

“amt If w’. ".21. ggp-i-kiidgkda . <119>

which causes transitions in which a photon is emitted and simul-
taneously an electron-positron pair is created. After a short time
the transition probability is proportional to the squared length of the
ket formed by multiplying (119) into the initial ket IQ), which is

Using the values of the P.B. and anticommutators given by (4), (16),
(72), (7 3), we get an integrand which depends on the k, k' variables
according to the law [k|"18(k--k’) for large values of k and k'. This
gives an integral that diverges, so the transition probability is inﬁnite.

The second term of (118), resolved into its Fourier components,
contains terms like ‘f;  L’:- ﬁﬂfwp», which cause transitions in which
two electron-positron pairs are created simultaneously. One can
calculate the transition probability as before, and one ﬁnds again
that it is inﬁnite. From these calculations one can conclude that the
state Q is not even approximately stationary.

A theory which gives rise to inﬁnite transition probabilities of
course cannot be correct. We can infer that there is something wrong
with quantum electrodynamics. This result need not surprise us,
because quantum electrodynamics does not provide a complete
description of nature. We know from experiment that there exist
other kinds of particles, which can get created when large amounts of

energy are available. All that we can expect from a theory of quantum

30s QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS § 81

electrodynamics is that it shall be valid for processes in which there
is not enough energy available for these other particles to be created
to an appreciable extent, say for energies up to a few hundred MeV.
Thus the high-energy part of the interaction energy (118) is quite
unreliable, and it is this high-energy part that is responsible for the
infinities.

It appears that we must modify the high-energy part of the inter-

action. At present there does not exist any detailed theory of the other
particles and so it is not possible to say how it ought to be modiﬁed.
The best we can do is to cut it out from the theory altogether, and so
remove the infinities. The precise form of the cut-off and the energy
‘Where it is applied will be left unspecified. Of course, the cut-off
spoils the relativistic invariance of the theory. This is a blemish
which cannot be avoided in our present state of ignorance of high-
energy processes.

Even with a cut-off the no-particle state Q is not approximately
stationary. It therefore-differs very much from the vacuum state.
The vacuum state must contain many particles, which may be
pictured as in a state of transient existence with violent ﬂuctua-
tions.

Let us introduce the ket IV) to represent the vacuum state. It is
the'eigenket of H* belonging to the lowest eigenvalue. Here and sub-
sequently H* denotes the expression (114) modified by the cut-off.
One might try to calculate IV) as a perturbation of the ket IQ), but
such a method would be of doubtful validity, because the difference
between IV) and IQ) is not small. No satisfactory way of calculating
IV) is known. In any case the result would depend strongly on the
cut-off, and since the cut-off is unspecified the result would not be a
definite one.

It follows that we must develop the theory without knowing IV).
This is not a great hardship, because we are not mainly interested in
the vacuum state. We are mainly interested in states which differ
from the vacuum through having a few particles present in addition
to those associated with the vacuum ﬂuctuations, and we want to
know how these extra particles behave. For this purpose we focus our
attention on an operator K representing the creation of the extra
particles, so that the state we are interested in appears as KJ V).

"We do not know how the ket IV) varies with the time in the Schro-
dinger picture, since we do not know the lowest eigenvalue of H*. ‘To

§31 DIFFICULTIES OF THE THEORY 309

avoid this difficulty we work in the Heisenberg picture in which I V) is
constant. We then require K I V) t0 represent another state in the
Heisenberg picture and thus t0 be another constant ket. This leads to

dK/dt = 0. (120)

Usually K will involve the time explicitly as well as Heisenberg
dynamical variables, so (120)gives

thaK/at-I-KH*-H*K = 0. (121)

We now have each physical state determined by a solution K of
(120)or (121). We obtained this result without knowing the vacuum
ket IV), and we can proceed to study K without knowing IV). The
only further information about K that we would have if we did know
IV) would be that two K's, say K1 and K2, would correspond to the
same state if we had (Kl-KQIV) = 0. But we can get on without
this further information and count all different K's satisfying ( 121 )
as corresponding to different states.

We are thus led to a drastic alteration of one of the basic ideas of
quantum mechanics, namely to represent a state by a linear operator and
not a ket vector. This alteration is brought about by the complexities
of applying quantum mechanics to a ﬁeld and by our ignorance of
high-energy processes.

A trivial solution of (120)or (121 ) is K = 1. This evidently corre-
sponds to the vacuum state.

A general solution may be put in the form of an explicit function of
t and of the dynamical variables at time t. Let us use the symbol v7,
to denote collectively the emission operators at time t. Thus m
equals one of the variables Mm, _* :9 at the time tin the Heisenberg

apr
picture. The absorption operators are then 1i, A solution of (121)then

appga“ as K = flinunﬁd- (122)

We require some physical interpretation for the state represented by
this K, as the usual physical interpretation of quantum mechanics,
requiring a state to be represented by a ket, is no longer applicable.
We shall need to make some new assumptions.

Keeping to the Heisenberg picture, we introduce at each time t the
ket IQQ satisfying the conditions (116) with respect to the Heisenberg
dynamical variables at time t. These conditions may now be written

“XIQO = 0-

The ket IQI) corresponds to no particles existing at the time t and it
provides a reference ket for the discussion of general states at time t.

310 QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS §81

For any state fixed by a solution K of (l2l)we form K |Q,) and
assume that this ket determines what can be observed at the time t and is
t0 be interpreted according t0 the standard rules. We obtain K in the
form (122) and then arrange it so that in each term all the absorption
operators ~73", are to the right of all the emission operators 17,. It is then
said to be in the normal order. Any term in K containing an absorption
operator then contributes nothing to K |Q,). The surviving terms in
K] Q, ) will contain only emission operators, like (ll 7). Each surviving
term is associated with certain particles in particular states, and the
square of the modulus of its coefficient (with the appropriate factors
n ! when there is more than one boson in the same state) is assumed to
be, after normalization, the probability of these particles existing in
these particular states at the time t.

We now have a general method of physical interpretation which is
rather similar to the usual one, but there are important differences.
A term in K with an absorption operator on the right will not con-
tribute to KIQQ and so will not contribute anything observable at
time t. We may call it a latent term at the time t. Such a term cannot
be discarded as non-existent, because it will contribute observable
effects at other times. These latent terms are a new feature of the
theory and are to be understood as an incompleteness in the descrip-
tion of a state in terms merely of the particles which can be observed
to be present at a certain time.

As a consequence of the occurrence of latent terms, if K IQQ is
normalized at one time, it will usually not be normalized at other times.
We thus have to carry out a separate normalization for each time in
order to derive the probabilities.

#82. Applications

There are two important applications of the foregoing theory in
which effects are calculated that cannot be obtained from a more
primitive theory. These applications are concerned with a single
electron in a static electric or magnetic field. As a consequence of the
interaction of the electron with electromagnetic waves, the energy
levels are shifted somewhat from their values given by the elementary
theory. The important cases are:

(i) An electron in the Coulomb field of a proton. The theory here
leads to a shift in the energy levels of the hydrogen atom. It is
named the Lamb shift, after its discoverer.

(ii) An electron in a uniform magnetic field. The extra energy is

APPLIUATTONS 311

here interpreted as arising from an eXtra magnetic moment of
the (xlectron, ealletl the anemalraus magnetic Inomcnt.

To take a, static lielcl into account one merely has t0 introduce
potentials to describe it and add them 0n to the Iiotrvntiatls in the
Hamiltonian. The potentials of the static ﬁeld ark functions of
X,, x2, x3 only, and are numbers for each X,, x2, x3, not dynamical
variables, so their introduction does not increase the number of degrees
of freedom.

The calculations of the Lamb shift and anomalous magnetic moment
are rather complicated. They are given in detail, Working from the
Hamiltonian H, in the author's book lectures 0n Quantum Field
Theory (AcademicPress, 1966). The results are in good agreement With
experiment and provide a conﬁrmation of the theory.

These calculations Were made in terms of the Heisenberg picture
throughout. One may tackle quantum electrodynamics on the
Schrodinger picture, looking for a solution of the Schrodinger equation
by taking the no-particle ket, or a ket corresponding to just a few
particles present, as the initial ket of a perturbation procedure and
applying the standard perturbation technique. One finds that the
later terms are large and depend strongly on the cut-off, or are
infinite if there is no cut-off. The perturbation procedure is not
logically valid under these conditions.

Nevertheless people have developed this method a long Way and
have devised Working rules for discarding infinities (in a theory
Without cut-off) in a systematic manner, so that finite residual effects
remain. The procedure is described in many books, e.g. Heitler's
Quantum. Theory 0f Radiation (Clarendon Press, 1954). The original
calculations of the Lamb shift and anomalous magnetic moment Were
carried out on these lines, long before the corresponding calculations
in the Heisenberg picture. The results are the same by both methods.

I do not see hoW these calculations based on the Schrodinger
picture, supplemented by some Working rules, ‘can be presented as a
logical development of the standard principles of quantum mechanics.
The Schrodinger picture is unsuited for dealing With quantum electro-
dynamics, because the vacuum ﬂuctuations play such a dominant role
in it. These ﬂuctuations present great mathematical difficulties, and
also they are not of physical importance. They get bypassed when one
uses the Heisenberg picture, and one is then able to concentrate on
quantities that are of physical importance.
