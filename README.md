Graphs for various other texts:

The graph visualization has since been extended to other texts:
- [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://rht.github.io/sicp-graph)
- [Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics](https://rht.github.io/sicp-graph/index.html?type=sicm)
   * Lagrangian mechanics is more related to rigid bodies than Hamiltonian mechanics.
- The Principles of Quantum Mechanics: [chapters](https://rht.github.io/sicp-graph/index.html?type=dirac), [sections](https://rht.github.io/sicp-graph/index.html?type=dirac_sections)
