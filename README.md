A graph visualization of the interconnectedness between the sections in SICP.

The graph visualization has since been extended to other texts:
- [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://rht.github.io/sicp-graph)
- [Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics](https://rht.github.io/sicp-graph/index.html?type=sicm)
   * Lagrangian mechanics is more related to rigid bodies than Hamiltonian mechanics.
- The Principles of Quantum Mechanics: [chapters](https://rht.github.io/sicp-graph/index.html?type=dirac), [sections](https://rht.github.io/sicp-graph/index.html?type=dirac_sections)
- [The Society of Mind](https://rht.github.io/sicp-graph/index.html?type=som). Sourced From http://www.aurellem.org/minsky/
  * Each sections are highly correlated with each other
